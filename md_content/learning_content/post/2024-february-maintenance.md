{{< alert-green >}}Rivanna, Research Project storage, and Research Standard storage will be down for maintenance on <strong>Tuesday, February 6</strong> beginning at 6 a.m. {{< /alert-green >}}

You may continue to submit jobs to Rivanna until the maintenance period begins, but if the system determines your job will not have time to finish, it will not start until Rivanna is returned to service. All systems are expected to return to service by 6 a.m. on Wednesday, February 7.

UVAâ€™s Facilities Management (FM) group will be updating the data center power grid during the maintenance period. This work is expected to be completed by 6 a.m. on 2/7.
