# Bradycardia and oxygen desaturation events in VLBW infants

Episodes of bradycardia and oxygen desaturation (BD) are common among preterm very low birthweight (VLBW) infants and their association with adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unclear. A better understanding of this relationship could lead to improved clinical interventions.

RC is helping neonatologists describe BD events in a large single-NICU VLBW cohort and test the hypothesis that measures of BD in the neonatal period add to clinical variables to predict BPD or death and other adverse outcomes. RC has implemented statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to assess the primary outcome of BPD in the context of a combination of clinical characteristics (like birthweight and gestational age) and bedside monitor features.

# Predicting Triage Level in the Emergency Department with Machine Learning

Before patients are admitted to the emergency room, they are assigned a triage level based on the severity of their health problems. This is accomplished using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), an emergency department triage algorithm that classifies patient cases into five different levels of urgency. Researchers are interested in using machine learning to develop a model to predict patient triage level. This model would not only analyze the typical vital signs that are used in the ESI, but also demographic data and patients’ history of health.

Demographic and health data have been collected. RC is helping to prepare and normalize the data for use in a machine learning model. RC is currently developing preliminary machine learning models for predicting triage level.

# Customized Secure Computing Environment for Surgical Research

RC is working with Dr. Eric Schneider to create a secure computing environment for the research of the Healthcare Surgical Outcome team. Data from this project will contain HIPAA identifiers, as well as Medicare information, and requires more security and control of data ingress/egress than projects previously hosted on the Ivy platform. After successful implementation of this project, RC will create a similar computing environment for DoD blast and traumatic brain injury data collected by Dr. Schneider before he joined UVA.

# Heart Rate Ranges in Premature Neonates Using High Resolution Physiologic Data

There are limited evidence-based published heart rate ranges for premature neonates. However, knowing heart rate reference ranges in the premature neonatal population can be beneficial for bedside assessment in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

RC is collaborating with clinical researchers in the Department of Pediatrics to establish baseline ranges for heart rate data in premature infants. These results are summarized from more than two billion data points collected via bedside monitoring in the NICU. RC staff has contributed data analysis and visualization expertise to aggregate the data, generate interactive heatmaps and produce tables of these ranges by gestational age.
