In their research around constant glucose monitoring and the automated maintenance of insulin for patients, the CDT is exploring data drawn from external data sources such as DexCom and FitBit. RC has assisted the CDT by designing a secure computing footprint in Amazon Web Services to pull in these data, parse and process them, in order to perform deeper analytics through machine learning. In January 2018, CDT sponsored a ski camp at Wintergreen Resort for a group of youth diagnosed with Type I diabetes with the goal of importing glucose, insulin, and exercise metrics at the end of each day through remote web APIs. This proof of concept has enabled the CDT to move forward with further monitoring efforts that draw upon existing devices and providers, rather than re-inventing them in a singular system.
