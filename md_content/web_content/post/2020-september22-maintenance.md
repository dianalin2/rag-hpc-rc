{{< alert-green >}}
Rivanna will be down for maintenance on <strong>Tuesday, September 22, beginning at 8:30 a.m.</strong> It is expected to return to service later in the day.
{{< /alert-green >}}

RC engineers will be installing new hardware that is needed to stabilize the `/scratch` filesystem.

You may continue to submit jobs until the maintenance period begins, but if the system determines your job will not have time to finish, it will not start until Rivanna is returned to service.

If you have any questions or concerns about the maintenance period, please contact our user support team at hpc-support@virginia.edu.
