The maintenance period has been extended for another **72 hours** minimum. We apologize for the inconvenience. Rivanna was expected to return to service on December 17, but ongoing electrical work in the data center and other obstacles have delayed our engineering team's progress.

We will send out an e-mail announcement as soon as the maintenance period ends. Updates will also be posted on our website.
