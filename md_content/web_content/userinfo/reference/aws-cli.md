<h4>AWS Command-Line Interface</h4>
<p>The AWS CLI is a command-line interface to the AWS service APIs. It allows users to interact programmatically with services such as EC2, S3, and others via <code>bash</code> and PowerShell scripts. 
This can be useful for local scripts or automated cron tasks. The AWS CLI also serves as a good introduction for programmatic API interaction using language-specific SKDs (Python, C#, PHP, Go, etc.)</p>

<p>Learn more at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_new"><b>AWS Command Line Interface</b></a> page.</p>

# Real-world example

Use a `bash` script to turn off your EC2 instance at night, and send you a notification. Use a similar script for a morning startup:
