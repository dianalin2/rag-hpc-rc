In cooperation with the UVA Saliva Testing Lab, the UVA Health System, and the Virginia Department of Health, the "Be SAFE" saliva
testing program was launched in late 2020. Now a retired project, Be SAFE used saliva samples to detect the COVID-19 virus through a diagnostic PCR test.

Research Computing provided computational, storage, and data integration expertise to this project.
