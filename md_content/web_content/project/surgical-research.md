RC is working with Dr. Eric Schneider to create a secure computing environment for the research of the Healthcare Surgical Outcome team. Data from this project will contain HIPAA identifiers, as well as Medicare information, and requires more security and control of data ingress/egress than projects previously hosted on the Ivy platform. After successful implementation of this project, RC will create a similar computing environment for DoD blast and traumatic brain injury data collected by Dr. Schneider before he joined UVA.
