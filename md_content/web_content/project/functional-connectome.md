Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to assess functional activity in the brain and connectivity between different regions of interest (ROIs), and a functional connectome is a map of the interactions between ROIs. Previous research has shown that a functional connectome contains enough unique characteristics, not unlike a fingerprint, that it can be used for accurate identification of an individual subject from a large group. RC is working with the UVA Functional Neuroradiology Lab to perform this fingerprinting analysis for a wide variety of populations and to develop innovative ways to visualize the results.
