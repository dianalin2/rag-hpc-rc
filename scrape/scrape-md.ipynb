This includes compilers (.cxx, .f90 and so forth), interpreters (.py, .R, etc.), image and video tools (.png, .jpg, .mp4). Since the format of the file extension depends on the expectations of software or on user preference, there is no rule limiting the number of characters, but most consist of one to three characters.\\n\\nDirectories are collections of files and other directories. Often they are called folders, but directory is generally the preferred (and historical) term in Unix.\\n\\nDirectories that are stored within another directory are subdirectories of the parent.\\n\\nBoth files and directories have “metadata” associated with them such as name, timestamps, and permissions.\\n\\nThe names of Unix files and directories should contain no spaces. ```bash $ls\\n\\n\\'10. directories.md\\' \\'15. streams.md\\' ``` The quotes indicate that a space is part of the file name. While most modern Unix tools can handle spaces, the shell does not always do so, and special precautions must be taken to avoid surprises. For that reason, underscores or hyphens are preferred instead of spaces.\\n\\nPaths\\n\\nIn most operating systems, all files and directories are located with a path. The “path” is the \"full name\" of every file & directory.\\n\\nIn a Unix-based operating system, the files are organized into a tree structure (the method to store and organize the files is called filesystem, e.g. ext3,ext4, NTFS, etc). The tree is \"upside down\" because the root directory is at the top, and directories branch off from there. The root directory is indicated with a forward slash /.\\n\\n{{< diagram >}} graph TD C[\"/\"] --> etc[\"etc\"] C[\"/\"] --> opt[\"opt\"] C[\"/\"] --> lib[\"lib\"] C --> usr[\"usr\"] C --> home[\"home\"] C --> var[\"var\"]\\n\\nhome --> mst3k[\"mst3k\"]\\nhome --> im4u[\"im4u\"]\\n\\nmst3k-->myfile[\"myfile\"]\\nmst3k-->mydir[\"mydir\"]\\n\\nmydir-->file1[\"file1\"]\\nmydir-->file2[\"file2\"]\\n\\nusr--> bin[\"bin\"]\\nusr--> share[\"share\"]\\nusr--> local[\"local\"]\\n\\nbin--> ls[\"ls\"]\\nbin--> pwd[\"pwd\"]\\nbin--> cd[\"cd\"]\\n\\n{{< /diagram >}}\\n\\nThe home directory is the usual name on Linux and similar Unix-based operating systems for the folder that holds user directories and files. On macOS it is called User. On both, the separator between branches of the tree is the forward slash.\\n\\n{{< hl >}} /home/mst3k/myfile {{< /hl >}} {{< hl >}} /Users/Misty Tea/Documents/Homework.pages {{< /hl >}}\\n\\nWindows files and folders also have paths. In Windows, drive letters or volumes are the top-level folders, and usually there is more than one. User files are in Users, similar to macOS.\\n\\n{{< hl >}} C:\\\\Users\\\\Misty Tea\\\\Documents\\\\Homework.docx {{< /hl >}}\\n\\nAbsolute and Relative Paths\\n\\nPaths may be absolute or relative.\\n\\nAn absolute path is path to a file or folder starting at the root. On Unix it will begin with /, to designate the root.\\n\\nAn absolute path is guaranteed to get you to the location you want.\\n\\nA relative path is the path to a file starting at the current location. We use the notation . (a single period) for the current working directory, and .. (two periods) for the parent of the current working directory.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nAbsolute paths: no-highlight /home/mst3k/file.txt /home/mst3k/files/file.txt /home/mst3k/projects/project1 /home/mst3k/projects/project1/output.txt Note that /home/mst3k/file.txt and /home/mst3k/files/file.txt are different files unless you explicitly link them.\\n\\nRelative paths. Suppose we are in the /home/mst3k/files folder. no-highlight ./file.txt ../files/file.txt The relative path to file.txt in files from the project1 folder is no-highlight ../../files/file.txt\\n\\nTilde Notation\\n\\nIn Unix the tilde ~ stands for the user\\'s home directory, e.g. /home/mst3k. no-hightlight ls ~ ls ~/files\\n\\nFile Commands\\n\\nls\\n\\nls lists files in a directory. bash $ls With no argument, listing the entire contents of the current working directory is assumed.\\n\\nLike most Unix commands, it has many options. They may be combined.\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Option | Purpose | |-------|-----| |-l | long listing, includes file date, size, and permissions | |-a | displays all files including hidden (dotfiles) | |-h | show file sizes in human-readable terms | |-C | lay out listing in columns | |-1 | (digit one) list one file per line, no header | |-t | show the newest files first | |-r | reverse the order | |-F |append a symbol to indicate the type of file (ordinary, executable, directory) | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nbash $ls -ltr ./projects\\n\\ncp\\n\\ncp to copy a file. bash $cp file1.txt file2.txt $cp mymod.py ../projects/python_code\\n\\nCommonly-used options:\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Option | Purpose | |-------|-----| | -i | ask for confirmation before overwriting an existing file | | -r | copy recursively all subdirectories| | -n | \"noclobber\"; do not overwrite an existing file| | -f | force an overwrite of an existing file| {{< /table >}}\\n\\nbash $cp -r /share/resources/tutorials/rivanna-cl ~\\n\\nmv\\n\\nmv to rename or move a file. bash $mv file1.txt file2.txt $mv mymod.py ../projects/python_code\\n\\nOptions for mv are similar to cp.\\n\\nrm\\n\\nrm to remove a file or directory\\n\\nbash $rm file1.txt $rm file1.txt data.csv Once the file is removed, it is gone and can no longer be accessed.\\n\\nOptions for rm are similar to cp.\\n\\n{{< warning >}} By default, the rm command does not ask for confirmation before deleting a file! Use the -i option if you are unsure. {{< /warning >}}\\n\\nDirectory Commands\\n\\ncd\\n\\ncd change directory bash $cd With no argument, cd moves to the user\\'s home directory. If you are hopelessly lost, you can always type cd and start over.\\n\\nbash $cd ../projects/project1\\n\\nmkdir\\n\\nmkdir to create a directory. Works relative to current working directory. bash $mkdir new_project or bash $mkdir new_project $mkdir ~/projects/new_project/src\\n\\nrmdir\\n\\nrmdir to remove an empty directory. Does not affect directories with content. bash $rmdir ~/projects/new_project/src\\n\\nrm -rf\\n\\nrm -rf to force the removal of a directory and all its contents, including subdirectories.\\n\\nbash $rm -rf ~/projects/project1/src\\n\\ncp -r\\n\\nDirectories are copied with the cp -r command previously discussed.\\n\\nExercise\\n\\nStart a terminal on a loginnode by whatever means you prefer. Type (the $ is the prompt and is not typed):\\n\\nbash $echo $SHELL $pwd $mkdir test_dir $cd test_dir $ls .. $mkdir sub_dir $ls\\n\\nQ1: What is the full path of your home directory?\\n\\nQ2: Delete the sub_dir folder.\\n\\nQ3: Copy the directory /share/resources/tutorials/rivanna-cl/shakespeare into your home directory.')]\n",

Wildcards enable you to work with groups of files without needing to type multiple files with similar names.\\n\\nThe asterisk * can replace zero to unlimited characters except for a leading period.\\n\\nThe question mark ? replaces exactly one character.\\n\\nExamples bash $ls *.py $cd array_test $ls input?.dat $ls input??.dat $ls input*.dat $rm list?.sh\\n\\n{{< warning >}} BE CAREFUL when using wildcards with rm! Gone is gone! On some systems there may be backups, or there may not be, and on your personal system you would need to set up backups and learn to retrieve files. It is advisable to first run an ls with the pattern you plan to use with rm. {{< /warning >}}\\n\\nStandard Streams\\n\\nEach executable has associated with it three input/output streams: standard input , standard error , and standard output. Normally these streams come from or go to your console (i.e. your terminal).\\n\\nMost Unix commands read from standard input and/or write to standard output.\\n\\nThese I/O streams are often represented as stdin, stderr, and stdout.\\n\\nThe Unix commands we have studied so far all write to standard output.\\n\\nbash $ls -l produces output to the terminal.\\n\\nStandard Stream Redirection\\n\\nThe standard streams are normally associated with the console. The command will print to the terminal, or will read input typed into the terminal. Stdin and stout can also be redirected to write to or read from a file.\\n\\nRedirect standard input with < bash $./mycode < params.txt\\n\\nRedirect standard output with > bash $ls –l > filelist.txt\\n\\nIf the file exists, > will overwrite it. Append with >>. bash $cat file1 >> bigfile.csv\\n\\nRedirection of standard error depends on the shell and is needed for only a few commands.\\n\\nFor bash bash $make >& make.out redirects both stdout and stderr from the make command to make.out.\\n\\nPipes\\n\\nOne of the most powerful properties of Unix is that you can pipe the standard output of one command into the standard input of another.\\n\\nThe pipe symbol | is above the backslash on most US keyboards. Pipes can be chained indefinitely, though most uses need just one. no-highlight cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3\\n\\nExample\\n\\nCommands such as ls have lengthy manpages that will tend to scroll off our terminal window. bash $man ls | more Now we can page through the listing.\\n\\nFinding and Searching Files\\n\\nSearching with grep\\n\\nThe grep command is commonly used in UNIX to filter a file or input, line by line, against a pattern. Patterns can be complex and use regular expressions, but most of the time wildcards are sufficient.\\n\\nno-highlight grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN FILENAME Example\\n\\nThe -i option stands for \"ignore case.\" bash $grep -i Unix intro_basic-unix.txt\\n\\nGrep is frequently used with wildcards and pipes. bash $grep -i write *f90 $grep weight: *md | grep 100\\n\\nExample\\n\\nHow many sequences are in a FASTA-formatted file? Each sequence record in a FASTA file has one line of description that always starts with >, followed by multiple lines of the sequence itself. Each sequence record ends when the next line starts with >.\\n\\nbash $grep -c \\'>\\' sequences.fasta The -c option returns the number of lines containing the pattern. Please be sure to include the quotes around the > or the shell will interpret it as a redirection.\\n\\nA Handy Trick\\n\\nTo find all occurrences of a pattern in all files in a directory, use grep -r. bash $grep -r \"print\" python_programs Be careful with the pattern for a recursive search, or the output can be excessive.\\n\\nFinding Files by Name\\n\\nThe find command can locate a file if you cannot remember its directory. It can take wildcards, in which case it is best to use quotes around the name pattern.\\n\\nbash $find . -name 2col.txt ./shakespeare/2col.txt $find . -name \"people*\" ./data/people.txt The period . tells find to start at the current working directory.\\n\\nFind has many options to locate files by name, type, date, and others. See here for examples.\\n\\nRunning Executables\\n\\nExecutables are often also called binaries. The terms are synonymous in most cases.\\n\\nThe shell has a predefined search path. It will look in a sequence of directories for an executable with the specified name, and will invoke the first one it encounters. If the executable is in this search path, you can simply type its name at the prompt.\\n\\nbash $gedit hello_world.sh\\n\\nhere gedit is the name of the executable. Its actual location is /usr/bin/gedit, but /usr/bin is in the default search path.\\n\\nIf the location of the binary is not in your search path, you must type the path to the executable (it can be absolute or relative)\\n\\nbash $./hello_world.sh\\n\\nFor security reasons the current directory is not in your default search path. Hence you must explicitly provide the ./ path to execute a binary in the current directory. If you wish to add it, type (for bash) bash $export PATH=$PATH:. PATH is called an environment variable. It holds the list of paths to be searched by the shell. In this example it is essential to add the first $PATH or you will lose the default path set by the system.\\n\\nIf you are unsure of the path to the binary you wish to run, the which command will tell you the path to the binary the shell will start. bash $which g++ /apps/software/standard/core/gcc/11.4.0/bin/g++\\n\\nProcess Control\\n\\nA running executable is a process to the Unix operating system. When it is run at a command line, a process can be running in the foreground, which suppresses a prompt, or in the background, which returns a prompt to the shell.\\n\\nTo start in the background, add an ampersand & at the end of the command. bash $./myexec -o myopt myfile&\\n\\nManaging Processes\\n\\nThe jobs command lists your running jobs (processes) with their job index.\\n\\nThe key combination control-z (ctrl-z or ^z) suspends the foreground job. To resume the job in the background, type bg.\\n\\nThis can be combined with output from jobs bash $bg %1 # place the job number 1 into the background $fg %4 # place the job number 4 back to the foreground\\n\\nFor more general information about processes, use ps (process status) The -u option limits it to processes owned by user mst3k. bash $ps -u mst3k PID TTY TIME CMD 498571 ? 00:00:00 systemd 498575 ? 00:00:00 (sd-pam) 498581 ? 00:00:00 pulseaudio 498582 ? 00:00:00 sshd 498593 pts/3 00:00:00 bash 498665 ? 00:00:00 dbus-daemon 498670 ? 00:00:00 dbus-daemon 498672 ? 00:00:00 dbus-kill-proce 498677 ? 00:00:00 gio 498685 ? 00:00:00 gvfsd 498691 ? 00:00:00 gvfsd-fuse 517189 pts/3 00:00:00 ps\\n\\nThe pid is the process id.\\n\\nKilling Processes\\n\\nYou have accidentally started a production job on a loginnode node. What to do?\\n\\nYou can kill your foreground process with Crtl c. ```bash\\n\\noops, I was supposed to run this through Slurm\\n\\n$./myexe ^c ```\\n\\nIf you need to kill a background process, you can use jobs to locate and foreground it. You may also have processes that don\\'t appear with jobs. Use ps to find the PID, then bash $kill -9 <pid> Do not type the angle brackets, just the number. Many processes will ignore the kill command without the -9 option so we routinely include it.\\n\\nTo kill by executable name bash $killall -9 <executable name> The kill command with -9 immediately kills the process without allowing the process to clean up or save data. The killall command can be used to kill all the processes that match a specific name or pattern.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in a jam and do not know what is wrong and you must start over, bash $kill -9 -1 kills all your processes, including your login.\\n\\nDotfiles\\n\\n“Dotfiles” are files that describe resources to programs that look for them. They begin with a period or “dot” (hence the name). In general, they are used for configuration of various software packages.\\n\\nDotfiles are hidden from ls, but ls -a shows them. Sometimes ls is aliased to ls –a.\\n\\nBash has configuration dotfiles: .bash_profile and .bashrc. * if no .bash_profile is present it will read .profile * .bash_profile is sourced only for login shell * the default .bash_profile on our HPC system incorporates the .bashrc; otherwise on a general Linux system, .bashrc is not run for a login shell.\\n\\nDot \"files\" may also be, and often are, directories.\\n\\nbash $ls -a . .bash_logout .bashrc .lesshst shakespeare .Xauthority .. .bash_profile data .mozilla .ssh')]\n",

Two versions of this OS are dominant today, Linux and macOS.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, \"Linux\" refers just to the kernel, which is the part of an operating system that manages the hardware interfaces. On top of the kernel sits a number of utilities that enable users and applications to interact with the kernel.\\n\\nLinux is the operating system most widely used at HPC facilities, internet servers, and the majority of financial trading system worldwide. A version of Linux powers Android systems.\\n\\nmacOS is based on a slightly different version of Unix.\\n\\nShell\\n\\nIn all version of Unix, the shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an interface between the user and the kernel.\\n\\nMultiple shells are available. In Linux systems, the default is the bash shell. MacOS formerly defaulted to bash as well, but has recently switched to zsh.\\n\\nThe shell displays a prompt, which indicates that it is ready to accept commands. In this tutorial, we will utilize the dollar sign $ as the prompt; yours may be different, and later in this tutorial we will learn how to customize it to your preferences.\\n\\nTo determine your current shell, at the prompt type\\n\\nbash $echo $SHELL\\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that Unix in general and the shell in particular is case-sensitive. The commands LS and ls would not be the same.\\n\\nLogging In\\n\\nLogging into a remote UNIX based system requires a program generally called a client. The options for the client depends on your OS.\\n\\nSSH\\n\\nCommand line access through a terminal on your computer is based on the ssh or Secure Shell protocol. It is * Encrypted * Available on most UNIX systems\\n\\nYour ssh client communicates with the ssh server program running on the remote system. Once established, the connection is secure even if the network is insecure.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nIf your computer is a macOS or Linux system, you log in with bash ssh -Y mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu Throughout this tutorial we will use mst3k as our example user ID. You should substitute your own. The option -Y allows access to graphical applications and requires that an X11 server application must be installed on your computer. This should be the default for Linux, but macOS users must install XQuartz before this command-line option will be useful.\\n\\nGraphical Applications\\n\\nThe command-line secure shell is not the only option for accessing the HPC system. Windows users in particular may wish to use other methods, since although ssh is available for it, Windows is not particularly friendly to command lines.\\n\\nOpen OnDemand (OOD)\\n\\nOpen OnDemand is a Web-based interface to the system. It provides a graphical file-management interface and access to several popular applications running on the compute nodes. A simple terminal that opens on a loginnode is also provided. See the introduction in our basic tutorial.\\n\\nFastX\\n\\nFastX is a Web-based graphical interface to a loginnode. It is also covered in the introduction.\\n\\nMobaXterm (Windows)\\n\\nMobaXterm combines an ssh client, a sftp client for file transfers, and an X11 server into a single bundle. More details are available at our Website or in the introduction.\\n\\nRunning Shell Commands\\n\\nThe syntax of Unix commands is not completely standardized but in general follow the pattern of a two or three-letter abbreviation followed by command-line options, which are single-letter options preceded by one hyphen or multiple-letter options with two hyphens. Many commands also take arguments.\\n\\nbash $cmd -o --option argument\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInvoke the utility rm to delete a file. bash $rm myfile In this example, the shell issues a request to the kernel to delete myfile. The kernel then communicates with the software that manages file storage to execute the operation.\\n\\nWhen it is complete the shell then returns the UNIX prompt to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands.\\n\\nRunning Our First Command\\n\\nLet’s run our first command. Into a terminal type bash $pwd /home/mst3k This command stands for print working directory. It prints the name of the folder in which the shell is currently working.\\n\\nNavigating the Bash Shell\\n\\nModern shells provide useful \"hotkey\" commands that can save considerable typing. The \"control-\" notation means that the Ctrl (control) key and the following key should be depressed at the same time.\\n\\n{{< table >}}\\n\\nFunction Key Tab completion: expand typed string to as far as it has a unique name. tab Search for earlier command control-r Move to the beginning of the line control-a Move to the end of the line control-e Clear the screen clear or control-l {{< /table >}}\\n\\nBash History\\n\\nWhen using bash you may use its built-in history mechanism to save yourself some keystrokes.\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Function | Key | |-------|-----| |scroll through the previous commands you have typed | up arrow| |if already scrolled back, scroll to more recent commands | down arrow | |edit text on a line | right or left arrow | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nLogging Out\\n\\nTo log out of a shell, type exit bash $exit\\n\\nThis logs you out of your current terminal window. If that is a login window, for example your ssh shell, it will log you out of the system entirely.')]\n",

Traditionally, Unix has assigned permissions to the owner (the user), the group (a set of users), others (users not the owner nor a member of the group that may have permissions on the file), and all (all users on the system). These are generally denoted by ugoa.\\n\\nWithin each category, a user can have permission to read, write, or execute the file. These are denoted by rwx.\\n\\nThe command bash $ls -l shows the permissions associated with each file. Since in Unix a directory is a special type of file, the permissions are the same.\\n\\n```bash $ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x. 2 mst3k mst3k 4096 Dec 18 10:39 data drwxr-xr-x. 2 mst3k mst3k 4096 Dec 18 10:22 shakespeare\\n\\n`` The output ofls -l` is\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Permissions | Number of \"Hard Links\" | Owner | Group | Size | Date and Time Last Modified | Name| | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ----------- | ---- | | drwxr-xr-x | 2 | mst3k | mst3k | 4096 | Dec 18 10:39 | data | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nPermissions not granted to a user are indicated with a hyphen -.\\n\\nThe permissions layout in the first columns should be read as\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Type | Owner | Group Owner | Others | | ---- | -------- | ------ | ---- | | d | rwx | r-x | r-x | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nIn the above example, the d indicates the listing is a directory. A directory must have \"execute\" x permission in order for a user to enter it.\\n\\nListing the files in a directory will result in output such as bash $ls -l shakespeare -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 91 Dec 18 10:22 2col.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 173940 Dec 18 10:22 Hamlet.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 162563 Dec 18 10:22 HamletWords.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 34 Dec 18 10:22 k2sort.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 180857 Dec 18 10:22 Lear.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 154520 Dec 18 10:22 Othello.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 25628 Dec 18 10:22 uniques -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 25628 Dec 18 10:22 uniques.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 72 Dec 18 10:22 wcdemo.txt -rwxr-xr-x. 1 mst3k mst3k 26 Dec 18 10:22 words_and_num.txt The hyphen as Type indicates an ordinary file.\\n\\nChanging Permissions\\n\\nThe owner of a file or directory may change the permissions with the chmod command. Two formats are supported: a three- or four-digit code (in octal, i.e. base 8) indicating permissions, or the add/remove symbolic format. The digit format is advanced so we will not discuss it; a reference is available here. The symbolic format is more intuitive and mnemonic.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nAdd execute permission to a file for its owner. This is frequently used with shell scripts. bash $chmod u+x ascript.sh\\n\\nAdd execute permissions for the owner and group members bash $chmod ug+x ascript.sh\\n\\nAllow others to read and write a file bash $chmod o+wr myfile.txt\\n\\nPlease note that on multiuser, central systems such as an HPC cluster, the administrators may not allow individual users to change the permissions on certain file sets such as home and scratch directories, for reasons of data security and privacy.\\n\\nCreating and Editing Files\\n\\nTo create files we use a text editor. Do not use a word processor such as LibreOffice.\\n\\nGraphical Options\\n\\nGraphical editors must be used from within a graphical environment. On Linux the standard graphical windowing system is called X11. Newer Linux versions provide some form of \"desktop\" environment similar to Windows or macOS on top of X11. On our system we provide the MATE Desktop Environment. It can be accessed from FastX on a loginnode. It can also be started on a compute node from the Open OnDemand Desktop Interactive Application.\\n\\n1. gedit/pluma\\n\\nModern Linux systems provide at least one graphical text editor. One option is gedit. On the MATE Desktop, the equivalent is pluma, but the gedit command starts pluma.\\n\\nGedit/pluma is very similar to Notepad on Windows.\\n\\n2. VS Code\\n\\nThis is accessed by a module. bash $module load code-server\\n\\nThen open a browser (Firefox is the default on MATE) and go to the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080. First set up would need a password that can be extracted from the file ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml.\\n\\nText-Based File Editors\\n\\nRegular Linux users are advised to learn at least one text-based editor, in case a graphical interface is not available or is too slow.\\n\\n1. vi (vim)\\n\\nThe oldest and most widely available text-based editor on Unix is vi for \"visual.\" Modern versions are nearly all based on vim (\"vi improved). On our system we generally alias the vi command to vim.\\n\\nVim/vi is used entirely through keyboard commands which must be memorized. The mouse is not utilized. Only a few commands are needed to be able to do basic editing and they are not difficult to learn. A beginner tutorial is here. One stumbling block for new users is that vim has command mode and insert mode and it must be toggled between the two.\\n\\nBasics: * To enter the insert mode press i * To enter the command mode press ESC * To save the file enter :w * To save under a new name :w filename * To exit :q\\n\\nMATE also provides a graphical interface called gvim. It can be accessed through the Applications->Accessories menu as Vi IMproved. GVim combines the keyboard-oriented commands of vim with some mouse-based capabilities.\\n\\n2. nano\\n\\nNano is simple text editor that is fairly self-explanatory and simple to learn. It is always in insert mode. A tutorial similar to that for vim above is here.\\n\\nBasics: * Immediately start typing * To exit: control+X * Type the filename and press Enter\\n\\n3. Emacs\\n\\nThe Emacs editor is another long-time editor on Unix. Similar to gvim, it combines a graphical interface, when available, with a keyboard-based command system. If the graphical interface is not available, such as from an Open OnDemand terminal, it will fall back to a text-only interface. Emacs is powerful and complex. The documentation is here.\\n\\nViewing Files\\n\\nPagers\\n\\nThe most widely used way to view files quickly without editing is to use a pager. A pager prints to the terminal window the amount of text that fits in that window. The default pager on Linux is more (also called less because \"less is more\").\\n\\nbash $more filename This displays the contents of a file on the screen with line scrolling. To scroll you can use ‘arrow’ keys. To advance one line, press the Enter key. To advance a full page, press the space bar. Press q to exit.\\n\\nbash $more ~/rivanna-cl/shakespeare/Lear.txt\\n\\nTo page upward within the text, press b (back).\\n\\nSearching.\\n\\nYou can search in the forward direction with /\\n\\nbash $more ~/rivanna-cl/shakespeare/Lear.text /serpent\\n\\n ...skipping\\n     Turn all her mother\\'s pains and benefits\\n     To laughter and contempt, that she may feel\\n     How sharper than a serpent\\'s tooth it is\\n     To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.\\n\\nSearch stops at the first occurrence. To locate the next one, type n.\\n\\nPrinting a file to the console\\n\\nThe cat (concatenate) command prints the contents of a file to the screen. bash $cat myfile It does not fit the output to the terminal windows size; it simply keeps printing to the end.\\n\\nIt can also be used to create or join files (hence its name). We will learn more about its behavior here when we look at standard streams.\\n\\n```bash\\n\\ncreate a file\\n\\n$cat > newfile Now I can enter some text It will be copied exactly into the file ^d `` The^dnotation means hold downCtrlandd` together. It is the end-of-file marker for bash.\\n\\n```bash\\n\\nappend a file to another\\n\\n$cat otherfile >> newfile `` {{< warning >}} If used single>in place of the double>>in the above,catwill overwritenewfilewithotherfile`. {{< /warning >}}\\n\\nDisplaying Parts of a File\\n\\nhead and tail\\n\\nhead filename\\n\\nDisplays only the starting lines of a file. The default is first ten lines. Use “-n” to specify the number of lines. bash $head ~/rivanna-cl/shakespeare/Lear.text\\n\\nThis Etext file is presented by Project Gutenberg, in\\ncooperation with World Library, Inc., from their Library of the\\nFuture and Shakespeare CDROMS.

If you are using a terminal from your local computer, you can also use some command-line tools.\\n\\nscp and sftp\\n\\nThe secure shell protocol includes two file-transfer command-line tools; scp and sftp. Sftp is scp with a slightly different interface.\\n\\nbash $scp LOCAL_FILE mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:REMOTE_PLACE $scp mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:REMOTE_FILE LOCAL_PLACE REMOTE_PLACE and LOCAL_PLACE refer to the location on the appropriate host where you want the file to be written. REMOTE_PLACE can be omitted and the file will be transferred to your home directory under the same name. To change the name or specify a directory on the other system, use a different name or path for REMOTE_PLACE.\\n\\nLOCAL_PLACE must be present but can be . for the directory where the scp was run.\\n\\nThe colon : is required.\\n\\nTo copy a directory, use scp -r similarly to cp -r.\\n\\nExamples bash $scp myfile.txt mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu: $scp myscript.py mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:project1 $scp myscript.py mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:script.py $scp myfile.csv mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:/scratch/mst3k $scp mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:/scratch/mst3k/run11/output.txt .\\n\\nScp resembles cp. Sftp is an implementation over scp of the interface of a popular, but insecure, protocol widely used in the past called ftp (file transfer protocol).\\n\\nbash $sftp mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu sftp> put local_file sftp> get remote_file sftp> quit The sftp client permits other commands. ls lists files on the remote system. lls lists local files.\\n\\nrsync\\n\\nThe rsync command is used to synchronize files and folders. It has many options and some attention must be paid to whether a trailing slash is needed or not.\\n\\nbash $rsync -av ldir/ mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:rdir $rsync my_file mst3k@login.hpc.virginia.edu:/scratch/$USER By default rsync does not transfer files that are older than the equivalent on the target. This can increase the transfer speed significantly. Rsync also resumes a transfer that was interrupted. Scp always starts again from the beginning.\\n\\nRsync is very powerful but has many options and can be confusing. For more details see our documentation. Several online resources with examples are also available, such as this.\\n\\nSetting up Passwordless ssh\\n\\nIf you will frequently use ssh, scp, sftp, or rsync to a remote system, it becomes inconvenient to repeatedly enter your password. Follow the instructions given here to generate a key to log in without a password.\\n\\nFinding Information About a Command\\n\\nBasic documentation for a command can be read from the shell with the man (manual) command. bash $man ls\\n\\nMany commands also provide a --help option which usually prints the same information. bash $ls --help\\n\\nThe output of man is often called the manpage of that command.\\n\\nExercise\\n\\nQ1: Create a directory called newdir. Navigate to it. Make the new file mynewfile and save it with ^d. Use nano or another editor of your preference and type a line or two of text.\\n\\nQ2: View the content of the mynewfile using more. Rename mynewfile to the_file. Copy the_file to old_file. List the files in long format.')]\n",

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the Biopython License, which is extremely liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world.\\n\\nThis workshop assumes a working knowledge of the Python programming language and basic understanding of the concepts of online DNA and Protein sequence repositories.\\n\\nIntroductions to Python can be found here and here.\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nPython code examples\\n\\nThe Python scripts and data files for this workshop can be downloaded from here. On your computer, unzip the downloaded folder and use it as working directory for this workshop.\\n\\nPython programming environment\\n\\nThe Anaconda environment from Anaconda Inc. is widely used because it bundles a Python interpreter, most of the popular packages, and development environments. It is cross-platform and freely available. There are two somewhat incompatible versions of Python; version 2.7 is deprecated but still fairly widely used. Version 3 is the supported version.\\n\\nNote: The latest Biopython package version (1.77+) requires Python 3.\\n\\nVisit the Anaconda download website and download the installer for Python 3 for your operating system (Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux). We recommend to use the graphical installer for ease of use.\\n\\nLaunch the downloaded installer, follow the onscreen prompts and install the Anaconda distribution on your local hard drive.\\n\\nThe Anaconda Documentation provides an introduction to the Anaconda environment and bundled applications. For the purpose of this workshop we focus on the Anaconda Navigator and Spyder.\\n\\nNavigator\\n\\nOnce you have installed Anaconda, start the Navigator application: * Instructions for Windows * Instructions for Mac * Instructions for Linux\\n\\nYou should see a workspace similar to the screenshot, with several options for working environments, some of which are not installed. We will use Spyder which should already be installed. If not, click the button to install the package.\\n\\nAnacondaNavigator\\n\\nSpyder\\n\\nNow we will switch to Spyder. Spyder is an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, aimed at Python. It is well suited for developing longer, more modular programs.\\n\\nTo start it, return to the Anaconda Navigator and click on the Spyder tile. It may take a while to open (watch the lower left of the Navigator).\\n\\nOnce it starts, you will see a layout with an editor pane on the left, an explorer pane at the top right, and an iPython console on the lower right. This arrangement can be customized but we will use the default for our examples. Type code into the editor. The explorer window can show files, variable values, and other useful information. The iPython console is a frontend to the Python interpreter itself. It is comparable to a cell in JupyterLab.\\n\\nAnacondaNavigator\\n\\nInstallation of the Biopython package\\n\\nIt is recommended to install the biopython package from PyPI using the pip install command. Detailed instructions are available here.\\n\\nOn your own computer: Start the Anaconda Prompt command line tool following the instructions for your operating system. * Start Anaconda Prompt on Windows * Start Anaconda Prompt on Mac, or open a terminal window. * Linux: Just open a terminal window.\\n\\nAt the prompt, type the following command and press enter/return: bash pip install biopython This command will install the latest biopython package version in your current Anaconda Python environment.\\n\\nOn Rivanna (UVA\\'s HPC platform):\\n\\nRivanna offers several Anaconda distributions with different Python versions. Before you use Python you need to load one of the anaconda software modules and then run the pip install command.\\n\\nbash module load anaconda pip install --user biopython Note: You have to use the --user flag which instructs the interpreter to install the package in your home directory. Alternatively, create your own custom Conda environment first and run the pip install biopython command in that environment (without --user flag)\\n\\nTesting the Biopython Installation\\n\\nStart the Spyder IDE (see here). In the IPython console pane, type the following command and press enter/return:\\n\\nimport Bio print (Bio.__version__)\\n\\nIf the package is installed correctly, the output will show the biopython version number.\\n\\nBio Subpackages and Classes\\n\\nThe Bio package provides a large number of subpackages providing specific functionality. The Biopython website provides a full list of all subpackages.\\n\\nThe following table shows an excerpt of that list relevant for this workshop.\\n\\nSubpackages/Classes Purpose Bio.Entrez Functions to retrieve Entrez records and associated data Bio.ExPASy Tools to access data hosted on the ExPASy protein databases Bio.SwissProt Tools to work with the sprotXX.dat file from SwissProt Bio.Seq Sequence datastructure (immutable=read-only) Bio.MutableSeq Sequence datastructure (mutable=modifiable Bio.SeqRecord Datastucture for Seq object plus enriched information Bio.SeqIO Read/write sequences (various file formats ) Bio.AlignIO A new multiple sequence Alignment Input/Output interface for BioPython 1.46 and later Bio.Align.MultipleSeqAlignment Tools for Code for working with sequence alignments\\n\\nOnline Datasets and Databases\\n\\nThe Bio module provides several classes to process output and datasets provided by the following web services and tools: * FASTA * Blast output – both from standalone and WWW Blast * Clustalw * GenBank * PubMed and Medline * ExPASy files, like Enzyme and Prosite * SCOP, including ‘dom’ and ‘lin’ files * UniGene * SwissProt\\n\\nIn this workshop we will explore options to download nucleotide and protein sequences from Entrez and ExPASy.\\n\\nAccessing NCBI\\'s Entrez Databases\\n\\nThe Bio.Entrez submodule provides access to the Entrez databases. When you use this module you need to know the String descriptor of the database you want to query (aka its name). A list of valid database names is provided in column three of this table.\\n\\nNote: Please review the General Introduction to the E-utilities for accessing the Entrez Application Programming Interface Program. The E-utilities limit the frequency of API calls and your IP address may be blocked if you continuously exceed the limit.\\n\\nBasic Steps:\\n\\nProvide an email address. This is required! Entrez.email = \"your@somewhere\".\\n\\nUse an E-utility to get a handle for the data of interest, e.g. handle = Entrez.esearch(...).\\n\\nUse handle to read or parse data with handle.read() or handle.parse().\\n\\nClose the handle with handle.close().\\n\\nAlso read \"What the heck is a handle?\"\\n\\nFind Database Records:\\n\\nLet\\'s find the protein records associated with the human Pax6 gene and download the associated sequences in FASTA format.\\n\\nTo search the database we use the Entrez.esearch function. We need to specify the database via the db, argument and specify a search term (provided as a list of Strings).\\n\\nThe following code is available in the entrez-fasta.py file.\\n\\n```python from Bio import Entrez\\n\\nEntrez.email = \"YOU@SOMEWHERE.com\" # your email address is required handle = Entrez.esearch(db=\"protein\", term = [\"Homo sapiens[Orgn] AND pax6[Gene]\"], usehistory=\"y\") record = Entrez.read(handle) handle.close()\\n\\niterate over items\\n\\nfor k,v in record.items(): print (k,v) ```\\n\\nThe search results are returned as a dictionary and we can retrieve the list of unique IDs that match our query via record[\"IdList\"].\\n\\nNote: The IdList returned by esearch is limited to the top 20 hits by default (defined by retmax). There are two workarounds: 1. Use the retmax=<number> keyword argument to increase the maximum number of retrieved records. The problem is you need to know what a reasonable number is. 2. Or better, use the usehistory=\\'y\\' keyword argument. This will save the search results on the remote server and provide WebEnv and QueryKey entries that can be used with the efetch function (see next section) to retrieve all search records (beyond the top 20).\\n\\nBy default the returned IDs reflect the GI numbers. The accession.version numbers can be retrieved instead by passing idtype=\\'acc\\' as an optional keyword argument to the esearch function. See the detailed documentation of the esearch function here.\\n\\nDownload and save sequences as FASTA file:\\n\\nWith the ID list in hand, we can now download the sequence records using just a few lines of code and save them in a single multi-sequence FASTA file. The efetch function is used when you want to retrieve a full record from Entrez.\\n\\n```python\\n\\nfetch records using id list\\n\\nhandle = Entrez.efetch(db=\"protein\", rettype=\"fasta\", retmode=\"text\", id=record[\"IdList\"]) result = handle.read() # return type is simple string handle.close()\\n\\nremove empty lines\\n\\nfastaseq = result.replace(\"\\\\n\\\\n\",\"\\\\n\") with open(\\'HsPax6-protein.fasta\\', \\'w\\') as f: f.write(fastaseq) ```\\n\\nAlternatively, we can pull individual sequences one at a time and save each sequence into a separate file. To do this we implement a for loop that iterates over this list and use the Entrez.efetch function to retrieve the FASTA sequence record associated with each id. We wrap this for loop in an open file operation block to save the retrieved FASTA records into a single .fasta text file.\\n\\nLet\\'s retrieve the nucleotide sequences of our previous top 5 ID hits as GenBank files. We specify the database with the db=\"nucleotide\" and format with the rettype=\"gb\" keyword arguments.\\n\\nThe code is provided in the entrez-genbank.py file.\\n\\n```python from Bio import Entrez\\n\\nEntrez.email = \"YOU@SOMEWHERE.com\" # provide your email address handle = Entrez.esearch(db=\"nucleotide\", term = [\"Homo sapiens[Orgn] AND pax6[Gene]\"], retmax=5, usehistory=\"y\") record = Entrez.read(handle) handle.close() for k,v in record.items(): print (k,v)\\n\\niterate over ids in list\\n\\nfor seq_id in record[\"IdList\"]: # get entry from Entrez print (seq_id) handle = Entrez.efetch(db=\"nucleotide\", id=seq_id, rettype=\"gb\", retmode=\"text\") result = handle.read() handle.close() # save filename = f\"HsPax6-{seq_id}-nucleotide.gb\" print (\"Saving to file:\", filename) with open(filename, \\'w\\') as gbfile: # append fasta entry gbfile.write(result.rstrip()+\"\\\\n\") ```\\n\\nNote that the record[\\'IdList\\'] may not represent all the records. Remember that the record[\\'WebEnv\\'] and record[\\'QueryKey\\'] entries provide access to the search history on the remote server. So we can use these instead of the record[\\'IdList\\'] to get all records. ```\\n\\nAlternative: fetch all records using search history\\n\\nhandle = Entrez.efetch(db=\"protein\", rettype=\"fasta\", retmode=\"text\", webenv=record[\"WebEnv\"], query_key=record[\"QueryKey\"]) ```\\n\\nExercise: Find and download the top 10 FASTA EST nucleotide sequences for the mouse (Mus Musculus) TP53 tumor suppressor. Hint: look up the EST database descriptor in this table.\\n\\nRetrieve Protein Records from the ExPASy Database\\n\\nHere are a few examples demonstrating how to access the ExPASy databases Swissport and Prosite. The Biopython documentation provides more details.\\n\\nSwiss-Prot\\n\\n```python from Bio import ExPASy from Bio import SwissProt\\n\\nget single protein record\\n\\naccession_no = \"O23729\" handle = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(accession_no) record = SwissProt.read(handle) print (record.entry_name) print (record.sequence_length) print (record.data_class) print (record.accessions) print (record.organism)\\n\\nprint first 10 aa\\n\\nprint (record.sequence[:10]) # string ```\\n\\nThe return type of SwissProt.read() is a Bio.SwissProt.Record object. In the above example we\\'re printing only a subset of its fields. The record.sequence field is a string, but it can easily be converted into a Bio.Seq object.\\n\\nTip: Use dir(record) to get a list of all record attribute names.\\n\\nProsite\\n\\n```python from Bio import ExPASy from Bio.ExPASy import Prosite\\n\\nhandle = ExPASy.get_prosite_raw(\"PS00001\") record = Prosite.read(handle) print (record.name) print (record.type) # e.g. PATTERN, MATRIX, or RULE print (record.pattern) print (record.rules) print (record.matrix) ```\\n\\nThe return type of Prosite.read() is a Bio.ExPASy.Prosite.Record object. Note: Use the Bio.ExPASy.Prosite.parse() function to parse files containing multiple records.\\n\\nProsite Documentation ``` from Bio import ExPASy from Bio.ExPASy import Prodoc\\n\\nhandle = ExPASy.get_prosite_raw(\"PDOC00001\") record = Prodoc.read(handle) ```\\n\\nExercise: Retrieve the SwissProt records for proteins with the following IDs: \"O23729\", \"O23730\", \"O23731\". Try to use list comprehension to create a list containing the records for all retrieved proteins.\\n\\nLearn more about SwissProt.\\n\\nScanProsite\\n\\nWe can query the Prosite database with protein sequences or motifs to find proteins with corresponding matches, see ScanProsite for details.\\n\\nOption 1: Submit protein sequence (use the seq= keyword argument) * UniProtKB accessions e.g. P98073 * Identifiers e.g. ENTK_HUMAN * PDB identifiers e.g. 4DGJ * Sequences in FASTA format.\\n\\nOption 2: Submit motif sequence (use the sig= keyword argument) * PROSITE accession e.g. PS50240 * Identifier e.g. TRYPSIN_DOM * Your own pattern e.g. P-x(2)-G-E-S-G(2)-[AS]. * Combinations of motifs can also be used.\\n\\n```python from Bio.ExPASy import ScanProsite\\n\\nuniprot_id = \"P26367\" # human Pax-6 handle = ScanProsite.scan(seq=uniprot_id) results = ScanProsite.read(handle) `` By executinghandle.read(), you can obtain the search results in raw XML format. Here we useBio.ExPASy.ScanProsite.readto parse the raw XML into aBio.ExPASy.ScanProsite.Record` object which represents a specialized list.\\n\\nWe can now access the found matches like this: print (\"Number of matches:\", results.n_match) for r in results: print (r)\\n\\nYou see that each item r represents a dictionary describing a specific match.\\n\\nWorking with Sequence Files\\n\\nSequence Objects\\n\\nThe Seq object is similar to a string object augmented with methods for nucleotide sequence operations including * find(), count() * complement(), reverse_complement() * transcribe(), back_transcribe() * translate()\\n\\nThe following code examples are in the seq.py script.\\n\\n```python from Bio.Seq import Seq\\n\\nmy_dna = Seq(\"ATGAGTACACTATAGA\") print (my_dna)\\n\\nfind position of first subsequence\\n\\nprint (my_dna.find(\"TAC\")) print (my_dna.find(\"AC\")) print (my_dna.find(\"CTC\"))\\n\\ncount\\n\\nprint (\"A count:\", my_dna.count(\"A\")) print (\"AC count:\", my_dna.count(\"AC\")) print (\"AA count:\", Seq(\"AAAA\").count(\"AA\")) # non-overlapping ```\\n\\nNote the return of -1 if no sequence match was found.\\n\\n```python\\n\\ncomplement and reverse complement\\n\\ncompl = my_dna.complement() rev_compl = my_dna.reverse_complement() print (\"original: \\\\t\", my_dna) print (\"complement:\\\\t\", compl) print (\"rev complement:\\\\t\", rev_compl)\\n\\ntranscription\\n\\nmy_rna = my_dna.transcribe() print (\"RNA:\", my_rna)\\n\\ntranslation\\n\\nmy_peptide = my_dna.translate() print (\"Peptide:\", my_peptide) ```\\n\\nLike Strings, Seq objects are immutable; this means that the sequence is read-only and cannot be modified in place. However, you can convert a Seq object into a MutableSeq object that allows you to manipulate the sequence after object initialization.\\n\\npython my_dna[2] = \\'A\\' # error, immutable Seq object mutable_dna = my_dna.tomutable() mutable_dna[2] = \\'A\\' print (my_dna) print (mutable_dna)\\n\\nNote that the sequence is zero-indexed: the first nucleotide has index 0, the second has index 1, and so forth. So in this example we\\'re changing the third nucleotide (index 2, G->A).\\n\\nExercise: Create a Seq object with a DNA nucleotide sequence of your choice. Find the first putative start codon (ATG), replace each \"C\" with a \"G\", and transcribe and translate the original as well as the modified sequence. Hint: As an intermediary step, convert Seq object to a string and use a string method for replacement.\\n\\nHandling Sequence Records\\n\\nThe SeqRecord class provides the following fields: * .seq: a sequence (as a Seq object) * .id: the identifier, e.g. an accession number (String) * .name: can be just the accession number or the locus name (String) * .description: self-explanatory (String) * .annotations: dictionary of additional often unstructured info (optional) * .letter_annotations: often used for quality scores or secondary structure info * .features: list of SeqFeature objects; more structured than annotations, e.g. gene position in a genome, or domain position in a protein * .dbxref: list of database cross-references\\n\\nSo it is used to wrap around a Seq object with richer information. We can manually create a SeqRecord object like this: ```python from Bio.Seq import Seq from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord\\n\\nrecord = SeqRecord( Seq(\"MKQHKAMIVALIVICITAVVAALVTRKDLCEVHIRTGQTEVAVF\"), id=\"YP_025292.1\", name=\"HokC\", description=\"toxic membrane protein, small\") print(record) ```\\n\\nThe above code example is in the seqrecord.py script.\\n\\nSequence File Operations\\n\\nThe Bio.SeqIO class provides simple tools to read and write a variety of sequence file formats (including multiple sequence alignments). It operates exclusively on SeqRecord objects.\\n\\nRead Fasta File ```python from Bio import SeqIO\\n\\nfile = open(\\'HsPax6-protein.fasta\\') fastarecords = SeqIO.parse(file, \"fasta\")\\n\\ncreate a list of SeqRecords\\n\\nfastalist = [entry for entry in fastarecords]\\n\\niterate over fasta entries\\n\\nfor entry in fastalist: print (f\"ID={entry.id}\") print (f\"Name={entry.name}\") print (f\"Description={entry.description}\") print (f\"Seq length={len(entry.seq)}\") print (f\"Features={entry.features}\") # empty for Fasta format print (f\"Sequence={entry.seq}\\\\n\") ```\\n\\nExercise: Filter the list of records to only include sequences with less than 300 amino acids.\\n\\nConvert Genbank to Fasta File\\n\\n```python from Bio import SeqIO\\n\\ngb_file = \\'HsPax6-208879460-nucleotide.gb\\' with open(gb_file) as f: gb_generator = SeqIO.parse(f, format=\\'gb\\') for entry in gb_generator: with open(f\\'Hs-pax6-{entry.id}-nucleotide.fasta\\', \\'w\\') as fileout: SeqIO.write(entry, fileout, \\'fasta\\') ```\\n\\nThe later versions of Biopython also include a Bio.SeqIO.convert() function. ```\\n\\nconvert GenBank to Fasta\\n\\ncount = Bio.SeqIO.convert(\"my_file.gb\", \"genbank\", \"my_file.fasta\", \"fasta\") ```\\n\\nAlignIO: Reading Sequence Alignment Files\\n\\nThe Bio.AlignIO class provides functions to handle paired or multiple sequence alignment files. It does not perform the alignment but provides tools to read/write alignment files and manipulate alignment objects. Bio.AlignIO uses the same set of functions for input and output as in Bio.SeqIO, and the same names are supported for the file formats.\\n\\nThe key functions are: * Bio.AlignIO.read(): For a file that contains one and only one alignment. The return type is a Bio.Align.MultipleSeqAlignment object. * Bio.AlignIO.parse(): A more general function when the file may contain multiple separate alignments. The return type is a generator that can be converted into a list of Bio.Align.MultipleSeqAlignment objects.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nLet\\'s create a Fasta file with Pax6 orthologs from human, mouse, xenopus, pufferfish, zebrafish (2), and fruitfly. The following code example is in the createPax6_fasta.py script.\\n\\n```python from Bio import Entrez\\n\\nget human, mouse, xenopus, pufferfish, zebrafish 1, zebrafish 2, Drosophila 1, Drosophila 2\\n\\nids = [\\'1587062735\\',\\'AAH36957.1\\',\\'NP_001006763.1\\',\\'XP_029701655.1\\',\\'NP_571379.1\\',\\'NP_571716.1\\',\\'NP_524628\\',\\'NP_524638\\'] handle = Entrez.efetch(db=\"protein\", rettype=\"fasta\", retmode=\"text\", id=ids) result = handle.read() handle.close() fastaseq = result.replace(\"\\\\n\\\\n\",\"\\\\n\") with open(\\'Pax6-multispec-protein.fasta\\', \\'w\\') as f: f.write(fastaseq) ```\\n\\nThis will create the Pax6-multispec-protein.fasta Fasta file with 8 sequences. The alignment was performed using Clustal Omega and you can download the Pax6-multispec-protein.aln alignment file and move it to your Python script folder that you use for this workshop.\\n\\nAlternatively, create the alignment yourself: 1. Visit the Clustal Omega website and upload the Pax6-multispec-protein.fasta file as input. 2. Under Step 1, click the Choose File button and upload the Pax6-multispec-protein.fasta file as input. 3. Under Step 3, click Submit. 4. When the alignment is done, click the Alignments tab, select the entire alignment output in the window and paste it into a text editor. Do not use Microsoft Word for this but programs like Text Edit, Notepad++, Emacs or vim instead. 5. Save the alignment in the text editor as Pax6-multispec-protein.aln in your Python script folder that you use for this workshop.\\n\\nThe following code examples are in the alignio-parse_clustal.py script.\\n\\nParse the alignment file ``` from Bio import AlignIO\\n\\ninputfile = open(\"Pax6-multispec-protein.aln\", \"r\")\\n\\nassuming single alignment in file; use AlignIO.parse for multiple alignments\\n\\nalignment = AlignIO.read(inputfile, \"clustal\") inputfile.close() print (\"Alignment length:\", alignment.get_alignment_length()) print (alignment,\"\\\\n\") ```\\n\\nUpdate identifier python species = [\\'H.sapiens\\', \\'M.musculus\\', \\'X.tropicalis\\', \\'T.rubripes\\', \\'D.rerio\\', \\'D.rerio\\', \\'D.melanogaster\\', \\'D.melanogaster\\'] for idx,line in enumerate(alignment): line.id = f\"{species[idx]}:{line.id}\" print (alignment)\\n\\nSlicing and joining ```python\\n\\nslice: first axis defines line, second axis defines column index (zero-indexed)\\n\\nget lines 1-6, first 50 columns\\n\\nsubset = alignment[:6,:50] print (subset) ```\\n\\nLet\\'s join two alignment blocks: python edited = alignment[:,:50] + alignment[:,500:] print (edited)\\n\\nExporting to other alignment file formats ```python\\n\\nsave as Stockholm\\n\\nwith open(\"Pax6-multispec-protein.sth\", \"w\") as outputfile: AlignIO.write(alignment, outputfile, \"stockholm\")\\n\\nget alignment as formatted string\\n\\nprint (\"Formatted Alignment:\") print (format(alignment, \"clustal\")) ```\\n\\nExercise: Find the first alignment block that shows no gaps across all 8 aligned sequences. 1. Print the block. 2. Save the block as a new clustal formatted text file. 3. From that block, extract the D. rerio (zebrafish) sequences and print the two sequences\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBiopython Tutorial and Cookbook\\n\\nUVA Research Computing')]\n",

Nowadays they are also used as accelerators for parallel computing; you may also hear the term \"general-purpose GPU\" (GPGPU).\\n\\n{{< table >}} |Property|CPU|GPU| |---|---|---| |Number of cores|$10^{0-1}$ | $10^{3-4}$ | |Throughput | Low | High | |Per-core performance | High | Low | |Workload type| Generic | Specific (e.g. rendering, deep learning)| |Memory on Rivanna| up to 1.5 TB per node | up to 80 GB per device | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nIntegrated vs discrete GPU\\n\\nIntegrated GPUs are mostly for graphics rendering and light gaming. They are integrated on the CPU motherboard to achieve more compact systems.\\n\\nDiscrete (or dedicated) GPUs are designed for resource-intensive computations.\\n\\nGPU vendors and types\\n\\nNVIDIA, AMD, Intel\\n\\nDatacenter: H100, A100, V100, P100, K80\\n\\nWorkstation: A6000, Quadro\\n\\nGaming: GeForce RTX 40xx, 30xx, 20xx\\n\\n(bold means available on Rivanna)\\n\\nMyths\\n\\nGPUs are better than CPUs and will eventually replace them. CPU and GPU complement each other. GPU will not replace CPU.\\n\\nIf I run my CPU code on a GPU, it\\'ll be way faster. This depends on whether your code can run on a GPU at all. Even so, if the computation is not resource-intensive enough, there will be no acceleration. In fact, your code may even be slower on a GPU.\\n\\nRunning a GPU program on two GPU devices will be twice as fast as running it on one. Again, this depends on whether your program can run on multiple GPU devices and the computation intensity.\\n\\nGPU acceleration only applies to data science and machine/deep learning.

The disadvantages are:\\n\\nWasted SU. All requested cores/GPUs count toward the SU charge, even if they are idle. (SU is the \"currency\" for resource usage on a cluster. The exact definition will be presented later.)\\n\\nLong waiting time. The more resources you request, the longer it is likely to wait in the queue.\\n\\nUnpleasant surprise to see little or no performance improvement.\\n\\nThe premise of parallel scalability is that the program has to be parallelizable. Please read the documentation of your program to determine whether there is any benefit of using multiple cores/GPUs. (Exception: A serial program may need more memory than a single core can provide. You will need to request multiple cores, but this is a memory-bound issue and is different from the execution speed. We shall not consider this scenario for the remainder of the tutorial.)\\n\\nWhat is benchmarking? And why/when should I benchmark?\\n\\nA benchmark is a measurement of performance. We will focus on the execution time of a program for a given task. (This is also known as strong scaling in parallel computing.) However, even for a serial program, a benchmark can still be useful when you run the program on different platforms. For instance, if a certain task takes 1 hour to complete on your laptop and 5 hours on Rivanna, there could be something wrong with how the program was installed on Rivanna.\\n\\nBut doesn\\'t benchmarking cost SU? Two things. First, the dev partition is the perfect choice for benchmarking and debugging purposes, as long as you stay within the limits. Remember, you do not need to complete the entire task if it takes too long; a fixed subtask would do. This could be an epoch in machine learning training, a time step in molecular dynamics simulation, a single iteration, etc., instead of reaching full convergence. This way you can perform the benchmark without spending SU.\\n\\nSecond, if the benchmark cannot be performed on dev for whatever reason (e.g. even the smallest subtask would take more than 1 hour, or the job needs more cores than the limit), it is true that you will have to spend SU for benchmarking, but you may still gain in the long term, especially if you are running many production jobs of a similar nature (high-throughput). If you manage to prevent overspending say 10 SU per job, then after 10,000 jobs you would have saved 100k SU, an entire allocation. (Linear term trumps constant, eventually.)\\n\\nBesides the amount of hardware, sometimes certain parameters of a program can have a huge impact on performance as well (e.g. batch size in machine learning training, NPAR/KPAR in VASP). You will need to find the optimum parameter to achieve the best performance specific to your problem. This may not translate across platforms - what\\'s optimal on one platform can be suboptimal on another, so you must perform a benchmark whenever you use a different platform!\\n\\nBenchmarking will also help you get a better sense of the scale of your project and how many SU it entails. Instead of blindly guessing, you will be able to request cores/GPUs/walltime wisely.\\n\\nConcepts and Theory\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nDenote the number of cores (or GPU devices) as $N$ and the walltime as $t$. The reference for comparison is the job that uses $N=1$ and has a walltime of $t_1$.\\n\\nSpeedup is defined as $s=t_1/t$. For example, a job that finishes in half the time has a speedup factor of 2.\\n\\nPerfect scaling is achieved when $N=s$. If you manage to halve the time ($s=2$) by doubling the resources ($N=2$), you achieve perfect scaling.\\n\\nOn Rivanna, the SU (service unit) charge rate is defined as $$SU = (N_{\\\\mathrm{core}} + 2N_{\\\\mathrm{gpu}}) t,$$ where $t$ is in units of hours.\\n\\nWe can define a relative SU, i.e. the SU relative to that of the reference: $$\\\\frac{SU}{SU_1} = \\\\frac{Nt}{t_1} = \\\\frac{N}{s}.$$\\n\\nIn the case of perfect scaling, $N=s$ and so the relative SU is 1, which means you spend the same amount of SU for the parallel job as for its serial reference. Since sublinear scaling ($s<N$) almost always occurs, the implication is that you need to pay an extra price for parallelization. For example, if you use 2 cores ($N=2$) and reduce the walltime by only one-third ($s=1.5$), then the relative SU is equal to $N/s=1.33$, which means you spend 33% more SU than the serial job reference. Whether this is worth it will of course depend on:\\n\\nthe actual value of $s$,\\n\\nthe maximum walltime limit for the partition on Rivanna, and\\n\\nyour deadline.\\n\\nAmdahl\\'s Law\\n\\nA portion of a program is called parallel if it can be parallelized. Otherwise it is said to be serial. In this simple model, a program is strictly divided into parallel and serial portions. Denote the parallel portion as $p$ ($0 \\\\le p \\\\le 1$) and the serial portion as $1-p$ (so that the sum equals 1).\\n\\nSuppose the program takes a total execution time of $t_1$ to run completely in serial. Then the execution time of the parallelized program can be expressed as a function of $N$: $$t = \\\\left[(1-p) + \\\\frac{p}{N}\\\\right] t_1,$$ where the time spent in the serial portion, $(1-p)t_1$, is irrespective of $N$.\\n\\nThe speedup is thus $$s=\\\\frac{t_1}{t} = \\\\frac{1}{1-p+\\\\frac{p}{N}}.$$\\n\\nAs $N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty$, $s\\\\rightarrow 1/(1-p)$. This is the theoretical speedup limit.\\n\\nExercise: a) Find the maximum speedup if 99%, 90%, 50%, 10%, and 0% of the program is parallelizable. b) For $N=100$, what is the relative SU in each case?\\n\\nb) First calculate the actual speedup (not the theoretical limit): 50.25, 9.17, 1.98, 1.11, 1. Relative SU: 1.99, 10.9, 50.5, 90.1, 100.\\n\\nNotice how the wasted SU increases dramatically.\\n\\nExercise: What is the theoretical limit in relative SU? $$\\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{SU}{SU_1}$$ Hint: Consider cases $s<N$ and $s=N$ separately.\\n\\nTools\\n\\nThe performance is usually tracked by the execution time.\\n\\ntime\\n\\nThe time command is included in most Linux distributions. You can simply prepend it to whatever command you want to time. For example:\\n\\n```bash $ time sleep 5\\n\\nreal 0m5.026s user 0m0.001s sys 0m0.006s ```\\n\\nNotice there are 3 lines of output - real, user, and sys. A good explanation of these can be found here; for this tutorial, it is sufficient to use the real time. (The CPU time is given by user + sys, which in this case is almost 0 because the command is just sleep.)\\n\\nperf\\n\\nA more dedicated tool for performance measurement is perf. Instead of a single measurement, it is more accurate to run a benchmark multiple times and take the average. The perf tool contains built-in statistical analysis. Advanced users please refer to the official tutorial. Load the module if you would like to use perf: module load perf.\\n\\nIf you just want to get a rough idea with an error bar of say 5-10%, time suffices. The task should last significantly longer than 1 second.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nMulti-core: Gaussian\\n\\nGaussian is a quantum chemistry software package that can run on multiple CPU cores. This example is the open-shell vanilomycin test (#0709) included with the software.\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nFirst load the module: bash module load gaussian\\n\\nIf you are using Gaussian only through a course: bash module load gaussian/grads16\\n\\nCopy the input file: bash cp $g16root/g16/tests/com/test0709.com .\\n\\nPrepare a SLURM script (job.slurm): ```bash\\n\\n!/bin/bash\\n\\nSBATCH -A\\n\\nSBATCH -p standard\\n\\nSBATCH -t 10:00:00\\n\\nSBATCH -N 1\\n\\nSBATCH -c 1\\n\\nSBATCH -C skylake\\n\\nmodule purge module load gaussian # or gaussian/grads16 hostname grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo cp $g16root/g16/tests/com/test0709.com . g16 -p=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK test0709.com ```\\n\\nNote: - The number of cores (#SBATCH -c <num>) is passed through the $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK environment variable to Gaussian\\'s -p flag. This ensures consistency. - $g16root is an environment variable made available to you after you load the Gaussian module. - The time command is not needed here because Gaussian will time the job automatically.\\n\\nSubmit the job: bash sbatch job.slurm\\n\\nBenchmark\\n\\nModify the SLURM script to use 4, 8, 16, and 32 cores. Submit these jobs. The walltime can be read from the test0709.log file.\\n\\nbash $ grep Elapsed test0709.log Elapsed time: 0 days 0 hours 15 minutes 35.4 seconds.\\n\\nYou should obtain similar results as follows:\\n\\nN Time (s) Speedup Relative SU 1 12323.9 1.00 1.00 4 2968.3 4.15 0.96 8 1528.5 8.06 0.99 16 935.4 13.18 1.21 32 842.2 14.63 2.19\\n\\nDon\\'t get excited about the apparent superlinear scaling ($s>N$ for $N=4,8$) - it is within the margin of error.\\n\\nThe speedup is plotted below. Notice the perfect scaling up to $N=8$. The scaling performance worsens beyond 8 cores and drastically beyond 16. This does not mean 8 is the magic number to use for all Gaussian jobs - it only applies to calculations of a similar nature.\\n\\n{{< figure src=\"gaussian.png\" width=\"600px\" >}}\\n\\nExercise: Does this obey Amdahl\\'s Law? Why or why not?\\n\\nMulti-GPU: PyTorch\\n\\nPyTorch can make use of multiple GPU devices through the DistributedDataParallel (DDP) backend. This example is based on our PyTorch 1.7 container using the Python script provided by PyTorch Lightning with minor modifications. (The container uses CUDA 11 which is compatible with Rivanna hardware after the December 2020 maintenance.)\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nDownload the container. The following command will create a Singularity container pytorch_1.7.0.sif. bash module load singularity singularity pull docker://uvarc/pytorch:1.7.0\\n\\nCopy the following as a plain text file (example.py).\\n\\n```python import os import torch from torch import nn import torch.nn.functional as F from torchvision.datasets import MNIST from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, random_split from torchvision import transforms import pytorch_lightning as pl\\n\\nclass LitAutoEncoder(pl.LightningModule):\\n\\ndef __init__(self):\\n    super().__init__()\\n    self.encoder = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, 3))\\n    self.decoder = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(3, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, 28 * 28))\\n\\ndef forward(self, x):\\n    # in lightning, forward defines the prediction/inference actions\\n    embedding = self.encoder(x)\\n    return embedding\\n\\ndef training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\\n    # training_step defined the train loop.

We would like to download the MNIST data files first and exclude the download time from the actual benchmark. (More on this later.) Also specify a GPU type for consistency.\\n\\n```\\n\\n!/bin/bash\\n\\nSBATCH -A\\n\\nSBATCH -t 00:10:00\\n\\nSBATCH -N 1\\n\\nSBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\\n\\nSBATCH -p gpu\\n\\nSBATCH --gres=gpu:1\\n\\nmodule purge module load singularity\\n\\ntime singularity run --nv pytorch_1.7.0.sif example.py ```\\n\\nSubmit the job. bash sbatch job.slurm\\n\\nBenchmark\\n\\nSet download=False in example.py: python dataset = MNIST(os.getcwd(), download=False, transform=transforms.ToTensor())\\n\\nResubmit the job to set the reference ($t_1$). Next, to make use of multiple GPU devices, use the ddp backend: python trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=1, gpus=2, distributed_backend=\\'ddp\\') For this example, use the same number in --ntasks-per-node and --gres=gpu in your SLURM script. Also add srun (important): bash time srun singularity run --nv pytorch_1.7.0.sif example.py\\n\\nResults on a K80 GPU:\\n\\nN Time (s) Speedup Relative SU 1 226 1.00 1.00 2 134 1.69 1.18 3 95 2.38 1.26 4 76 2.97 1.35\\n\\nThe speedup is plotted below.

The entire project involves 1,000 such jobs. Assume that all 1,000 jobs can start running immediately. (The standard partition has a walltime limit of 7 days. No job extensions can be granted.) a) What is the minimum amount of SU needed to finish the entire project? b) The user has a deadline of 3 days. How many cores should the user request per job? How many extra SU will need to be spent compared to the minimum in a)? c) Suppose the user did not perform the benchmark and just randomly decided to use 20 cores per job. How much time and how many SU will the user spend for this project? Compare your answer with b). d) Repeat b) but this time the deadline is in 50 hours.\\n\\nThe moral of this exercise is two-fold: do your benchmark and plan ahead!')]\n",

Programs look \"in the environment\" for particular variables and if they are found will use the values stored. Some are set by the system, others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program. Standard Unix variables are split into two categories, environment variables and shell variables. In broad terms, shell variables apply only to the current instance of the shell and are used to set short-term working conditions. Environment variables are exported and have a farther reaching significance; those set at login are valid for the duration of the session. By convention, environment variables are written in UPPERCASE while shell variables usually have lowercase names.\\n\\nEnvironment Variables\\n\\nAn example of an environment variable is the $SHELL variable. The value of this is the current shell you are using. Type bash % echo $SHELL\\n\\nMore examples of environment variables are bash $USER (your login name) $HOME (the path name of your home directory) $PWD (current working directory) $DISPLAY (the name of the computer screen to display X windows; only set if X is enabled) $PATH (the directories the shell should search to find a command)\\n\\nUsing and Setting Variables\\n\\nEnvironment variables are set using the export command (bash or zsh) or the setenv command (tcsh or csh), displayed using the printenv (bash, tcsh) or env (bash, zsh) commands, and unset using the unsetenv command. To show all values of these variables, type\\n\\nbash % printenv | more\\n\\nTo set a value of an environment variable, type (for bash)\\n\\nbash % export VAR=value\\n\\nSourcing\\n\\nA group of shell commands can be placed into a file and then sourced. When a file is sourced, the commands are executed as if they had been typed at the command line in the current shell. For example, if several environment variables needed to be set over and over again, they could be collected into a file such as this simple script called envs.sh:\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/unix-tutorial/snippets/envs.sh\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nExercise 6A\\n\\nDownload the envs.sh file to the Unix system you are using. Run the command bash source envs.sh\\n\\nPrint the values of the environment variables in the file. To print the value of the shell variable ncpus, type bash echo $ncpus\\n\\nDotfiles\\n\\nEach time you log in to a Unix host, the system looks in your home directory for initialization files. Information in these files is used to set up your working environment. The first initialization file sourced is the login initialization. It is sourced only in the login shell. Note: modern \"desktop\" user interfaces tend to \"swallow\" the login setup file, and it may be difficult to determine what is happening in these cases if there is an error.\\n\\nAt login the bash shell first sources .bash_profile or .profile (if .bash_profile exists .profile will be ignored). Child shells source .bashrc. The zsh sources .zprofile and child shells source .zshrc. Two older shells, csh (C shell) and tcsh, read .login for login shells and .cshrc or .tcshrc for all other shells.\\n\\nNote that all these file names begin with periods or \"dots\"; hence they are called dotfiles. As we have learned, dotfiles are hidden and will only be visible with ls -a.\\n\\nThe .bash_profile, .profile, or .login is to set conditions which will apply to the whole session and/or to perform actions that are relevant only at login. The .bashrc, .zshrc, or .tcshrc file is used to set conditions and perform actions specific to the shell and to each invocation of it. The rc stands for resource; many Unix dotfiles use this convention to set resources.\\n\\nIf you wish for your login shell to source the .bashrc also, add the lines bash if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc fi to the .bash_profile script.\\n\\nWarning: NEVER put commands that run graphical displays (e.g. web browsers) in your dotfiles. If you change your .bashrc you can force the shell to reread it by using the shell source command.\\n\\n% source ~/.bashrc\\n\\nSetting the Path\\n\\nWhen you type a command, your path (or $PATH) variable defines in which directories the shell will look to find the command you typed. If the system returns a message saying \"command: Command not found\", this indicates that either the command doesn\\'t exist at all on the system or it is simply not in your path.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you have installed a program called \"units\" into your home directory in a folder called units174. Units is a simple utility that can convert Imperial to metric and vice versa, from SI to cgi, and so forth. This folder contains a bin subdirectory in which the executable is located. To run units, you must either directly specify the units path (~/units174/bin/units), or you need to have the directory ~/units174/bin in your path. You can add it to the end of your existing path (the $PATH represents this) by issuing the command: bash % export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/units174/bin\\n\\nIf you have units installed you can test that this worked by trying to run units in any directory other than where units is actually located. % cd; units Hint: You can run multiple commands on one line by separating them with a semicolon.\\n\\nTo add this path permanently, add the export line to your .bashrc file after the list of other commands. Make sure that you include the $PATH when you reset it, or you will lose access to basic system commands!')]\n",

For example, in your unixstuff directory, type\\n\\nbash % ls list* This will list all files in the current directory starting with list. Try typing % ls *list This will list all files in the current directory ending with list. The character ? will match exactly one character. So ls ?ouse will match files like house and mouse, but not grouse. Try typing bash % ls ?list\\n\\nFilename Conventions\\n\\nUnix regards a directory as merely a special type of file. So the rules and conventions for naming files apply also to directories. In naming files, characters with special meanings, such as / * & %, should be avoided. Also avoid using spaces within names. The safest way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot). File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter, and may end with a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For example, all files consisting of C code may be named with the ending .c, for example, prog1.c. Then in order to list all files containing C code in your home directory, you need only type ls *.c in that directory.\\n\\nBeware: some applications give the same name to all the output files they generate. For example, some compilers, unless given the appropriate option, produce compiled files named a.out. Should you forget to use that option, you are advised to rename the compiled file immediately, otherwise the next such file will overwrite it and the original file will be lost.\\n\\nThe Unix system itself ignores file suffixes. You could name your C++ program mycode.py and Linux will not care. However, many applications do care about file extensions. A C++ compiler will expect the file to end in .cpp or .cxx. It will not recognize a file ending in .py, but a Python interpreter would.\\n\\nFilesystem Security (Access Rights)\\n\\nIn your unixstuff directory, type % ls -l (l for long listing!) You will see that you now get lots of details about the contents of your directory, similar to the example below.\\n\\n{{< code file=\"/notes/unix-tutorial/snippets/ls-l.txt\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nEach file (and directory) has associated access rights, which may be found by typing ls -l.\\n\\nIn the left-hand column is a 10-symbol string consisting of the symbols d, r, w, x, -, and, occasionally, s or S. If d is present, it will be at the left hand end of the string and indicates a directory; otherwise - will be the starting symbol of the string. The nine remaining symbols indicate the permissions, or access rights, and are taken as three groups of three.\\n\\nthe leftmost group of 3 gives the file permissions for the user that owns the file (or directory) (mst3k in the above example);\\n\\nthe middle group gives the permissions for the group of people to whom the file (or directory) belongs (users in the above example);\\n\\nthe rightmost group gives the permissions for all others. The symbols r, w, etc., have slightly different meanings depending on whether they refer to a simple file or to a directory.\\n\\nAccess Rights on Files\\n\\nr (or -), indicates read permission, that is, the presence or absence of permission to read and copy the file\\n\\nw (or -), indicates write permission, that is, the permission (or otherwise) to change a file\\n\\nx (or -), indicates execution permission, that is, the permission to execute a file, where appropriate\\n\\nAccess Rights on Directories\\n\\nr allows users to list files in the directory\\n\\nw means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it\\n\\nx means the right to access files in the directory or to cd into it.\\n\\nSo, in order to read a file, you must have execute permission on the directory containing that file, and hence on any directory containing that directory as a subdirectory, and so on, up the tree.\\n\\nSome Examples\\n\\nPermissions Meaning -rwxrwxrwx a file that everyone can read, write and execute (and delete) -rw------- a file that only the owner can read and write: no one else can read or write and no one has execution rights (e.g., yourmailbox file)\\n\\nChanging Access Rights\\n\\nchmod (changing a file mode)\\n\\nOnly the owner of a file can use chmod to change the permissions of a file. The options of chmod are as follows:\\n\\nSymbol Meaning u user g group o other a all r read w write (and delete) x execute (and access directory) + add permission - take away permission For example, to remove read write and execute permissions on the file biglist for the group and others, type ``` % chmod go-rwx biglist ``` This will leave the other permissions unaffected. To give read and write permissions on the file biglist to all, ``` % chmod a+rw biglist ```\\n\\nExercise 4A\\n\\nTry changing access permissions on the file science.txt and on the directory backups. Use ls -l to check that the permissions have changed.\\n\\nShared Systems\\n\\nSome multiuser systems, such as high-performance clusters, may not permit chmod on certain directories, or may automatically revert to the default set of permissions (called the umask). This is for data protection and privacy for users.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCommand Operation * match any number of characters ? match one character chmod change file or directory permissions')]\n",

There is also the standard error, where processes write their error messages, by default to the terminal screen. Type cat without specifying a file to read bash % cat Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the [Return] key. Finally hold the [CTRL] key down and press [d] (written as ^D for short) to end the input. What has happened? If you run the cat command without specifying a file to read, it reads the standard input (the keyboard), and on receiving the \\'end of file\\' (^D), copies it to the standard output (the screen). In UNIX, we can redirect both the input and the output of commands.\\n\\nRedirecting the Output\\n\\nWe use the > symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called list1 containing a list of fruit, type bash % cat > list1 Then type in the names of some fruit as follows. Press [Return] after each one. Terminate with the end-of-file marker control-d (^D). no-highlight pear banana apple ^D The cat command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the > redirects the output, which normally goes to the screen, into a file called list1. To read the contents of the file, type bash % cat list1\\n\\nExercise 3A\\n\\nUsing the above method, create another file called list2 containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. The form >> appends standard output to a file. So to add more items to the file list1, type bash % cat >> list1 Then type in the names of more fruit no-highlight peach grape strawberry ^D To read the contents of the file, type bash % cat list1\\n\\nYou should now have two files. One contains six fruit names, the other contains four fruits. We will now use the cat command to join (concatenate) list1 and list2 into a new file called biglist. Type\\n\\nbash % cat list1 list2 > biglist This reads the contents of list1 and list2 in turn, then outputs the text to the file biglist. To read the contents of the new file, type bash % cat biglist\\n\\nRedirecting the Input\\n\\nWe use the < symbol to redirect the input of a command. The command sort alphabetically or numerically sorts a list. Type bash % sort Using < you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the keyboard. For example, to sort the list of fruit, type bash % sort < biglist and the sorted list will be output to the screen. To output the sorted list to a file, type bash % sort < biglist > slist Use cat to read the contents of the file slist.\\n\\nPipes\\n\\nTo see who is on the system with you, type bash % who One method to get a sorted list of names is to type bash % who > names.txt % sort < names.txt This is a bit slow and you have to remember to remove the temporary file called names.txt when you have finished. What you really want to do is connect the output of the who command directly to the input of the sort command. This is exactly what pipes do. The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar | which, on a US keyboard, is above Enter on the right, with the backslash. For example, typing bash % who | sort will give the same result as above, but quicker and cleaner. To find out how many users are logged on, use wc (word count) with the option -l (ell) for number of lines only: bash % who | wc -l\\n\\nExercise 3B\\n\\nUsing pipes, print all lines of list1 and list2 containing the letter \\'p\\', sort the result, and print to a file sorted_plist.txt. Hint: from grep --help find an option to print only the line, omitting the file name.\\n\\n{{< spoiler text=\"Solution\" >}} {{< code file=\"/notes/unix-tutorial/snippets/ex3b.txt\" lang=\"bash\" >}} {{< /spoiler >}}\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCommand Operation command > file redirect standard output to a file command >> file append standard output to a file command < file redirect standard input from a file command1 command2 cat file1 file2 > file0 concatenate file1 and file2 to file0 sort sort data who list users currently logged in')]\n",

To see information about your processes, with their associated PID and status, type bash % ps -u mst3k\\n\\nA process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. In general the shell does not return the Unix prompt until the current process has finished executing. Some processes take a long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding a long process has the effect that the Unix prompt is returned immediately, and other tasks can be carried out while the original process continues executing.\\n\\nRunning Background Processes\\n\\nTo background a process, type an & at the end of the command line. For example, the command sleep waits a given number of seconds before continuing. Type bash % sleep 10 This will wait 10 seconds before returning the command prompt %. Until the command prompt is returned, you can do nothing in that terminal except wait. To run sleep in the background, type ```bash % sleep 10 &\\n\\n[1] 6259 `` The&` runs the process in the background and returns the prompt immediately, allowing you to run other programs while waiting for that one to finish. The first line in the above example is typed in by the user; the next line, indicating job number and PID, is returned by the machine. The user is notified of a job number (numbered from 1) enclosed in square brackets, together with a PID and is notified when a background process is finished. Backgrounding is useful for jobs which will take a long time to complete.\\n\\nTo the system, a \"job\" represents a group of processes (often just one) to which signals should be sent. Signals include backgrounding, foregrounding, and cancelling. This meaning of \"job\" must be distinguished from \"jobs\" submitted to a queueing system such as Slurm. To a resource manager (queueing system) a \"job\" is a set of instructions to be executed.\\n\\nBackgrounding a Current Foreground Process\\n\\nAt the prompt, type bash % sleep 100 You can suspend the process running in the foreground by holding down the [CTRL] key and typing [z] (written as ^Z) Then to put it in the background, type bash % bg Note: do not background programs that require user interaction.\\n\\nListing Suspended and Background Processes\\n\\nWhen a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto a list along with a job number. To examine this list, type bash % jobs An example of a job list could be\\n\\nSuspended sleep 100\\n\\nRunning firefox\\n\\nRunning vi\\n\\nTo restart (foreground) a suspended processes, type bash % fg %jobnumber For example, to restart sleep 100, type bash % fg %1\\n\\nTyping fg with no job number foregrounds the last suspended process.\\n\\nKilling a Process\\n\\nkill (terminate or signal a process)\\n\\nIt is sometimes necessary to kill a process (for example, when an executing program is in an infinite loop). To kill a job running in the foreground, type ^C ([CTRL] + [c]). For example, run bash % sleep 100 ^C\\n\\nTo kill a suspended or background process, type bash % kill %jobnumber\\n\\nFor example, run ```bash % sleep 100 &\\n\\n% jobs ```\\n\\nIf it is job number 4, type bash % kill %4\\n\\nTo check whether this has worked, examine the job list again to see if the process has been removed.\\n\\nps (process status)\\n\\nAlternatively, processes can be killed by finding their process numbers (PIDs) and using kill PID_number: ``` % sleep 100 & % ps\\n\\nPID TTY TIME CMD 20077 pts/5 S 0:05 sleep 100 21563 pts/5 T 0:00 firefox 21873 pts/5 S 0:25 vi To kill off the process `sleep 100`, type % kill 20077 and then type ps again to see if it has been removed from the list. If a process refuses to be killed, uses the `-9` option, i.e., type % kill -9 20077 ```\\n\\nLinux systems support a command killall which takes the name of the process rather than its PID. bash killall -9 sleep Note: It is not possible to kill off other users\\' processes!

The shell always searches from left to right in the list contained in the PATH environment variable; the first executable of the specified name is the one that is used.\\n\\nwc\\n\\nThe wc command returns the number of lines, words, and characters in an ASCII file. A word is defined as a non-zero length string surrounded by whitespace. % wc myfile.txt\\n\\nTo print only the number of lines, use bash % wc –l myfile.txt\\n\\ndiff\\n\\ndiff shows the differences between two ASCII files on a per-line basis. bash % diff file1 file2\\n\\nfind\\n\\nfind is an extremely powerful command with many options. The simplest and most common use of it is to search for a file of a given name or with a name containing a pattern. bash % find . -name myscript.sh This starts from current directory (.) and searches for myscript.sh. The period is optional under Linux (but not under Mac OSX). To search for a name with a pattern it must typically be enclosed in quotes bash % find . -name \"*.sh\"\\n\\nSee the manpage or examples online for more usage patterns of this command.\\n\\ndu\\n\\nThe du command outputs the number of kilobytes used by each subdirectory. Useful if you have gone over quota and you want to find out which directory has the most files. Some options make it more useful; in particular, -s summarizes directories and -h prints it in human-readable format. In your home directory, type bash % du -s -h *\\n\\ngzip and zip\\n\\nThis reduces the size of a file, thus freeing valuable disk space. For example, type bash % ls -l science.txt and note the size of the file. Then to compress science.txt, type bash % gzip science.txt\\n\\nThis will compress the file and place it in a file called science.txt.gz. To see the change in size, type ls -l again. To uncompress the file, use the gunzip command. % gunzip science.txt.gz\\n\\nMost Linux systems also provide the standard zip and unzip commands. bash % zip science.txt.zip % unzip science.txt.zip\\n\\ntar (tape archive)\\n\\nThe standard archive format in Linux is tar. Tar is usually used to bundle directories. (Zip can also be used for this purpose.) Typically the output file is compressed with gzip. bash tar czf mydir.tar.gz mydir The c option creates the tarfile (also called a \"tarball\"). The f option is for file, and this form of the command must be followed by the name of the file to contain the archive. The z option gzips the file.\\n\\nTo extract the files bash tar xf mydir.tar.gz Newer versions of tar can detect that the archive is zipped, so a z is not necessary for extraction. The x option extracts. This will create the directory mydir if it does not exist. If it does, the contents will be replaced by the contents of mydir.tar.gz.\\n\\nfile\\n\\nfile classifies the named files according to the type of data they contain, for example ASCII (text), pictures, compressed data, etc. To report on all files in your home directory, type bash % file *\\n\\ncut\\n\\nThe cut command extracts selected portions of a line, based on fields separated by a delimiter % cut\\xad?d delim \\xad?fC1,C2,C3\\n\\nExamples: bash % cut -d \\' \\' ?f1 /etc/resolve.conf % cat myfile | cut -c 80\\n\\nsort\\n\\nThis command sorts lines of a text file, based on command-\\xadline options. The default is to sort alphabetically, based on lexicographical ordering (in which e.g. 100 comes before 2). bash % sort mylist.txt\\n\\nuniq\\n\\nRemoves duplicate lines (file must be sorted first since it only compares lines pairwise). bash % uniq mylist.txt\\n\\nA frequent pattern is to pipe the output of sort into uniq bash % sort animals | uniq\\n\\nhistory\\n\\nThe bash shell keeps an ordered list of all the commands that you have entered. Each command is given a number according to the order it was entered. bash % history (show command history list) If you are using the bash or tcsh shell, you can use the exclamation character (!) to recall commands easily.\\n\\nbash % !! (recall last command) % !-3 (recall third most recent command) % !5 (recall 5th command in list) % !grep (recall last command starting with grep) You can increase the size of the history buffer by typing % set history=100')]\n",

Click the down-arrow icon to download the file. Use whatever method you know to place this file into your home directory.\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/unix-tutorial/snippets/science.txt\" lang=\"no-highlight\" >}}\\n\\nbash % cd ~/unixstuff\\n\\nThen at the Unix prompt, type,\\n\\nbash % cp ../science.txt .\\n\\nNote: Don\\'t forget the dot (.) at the end. Remember, in UNIX, the dot means the current directory.\\n\\nThe above command means copy the file science.txt from the parent directory to the current directory, keeping the name the same. To change the name, use bash % cp ../science.txt ./newname\\n\\nExercise 2A\\n\\nCreate a backup of your science.txt file by copying it to a file called science.bak.\\n\\nMoving Files\\n\\nmv (move)\\n\\nmv file1 file2 moves (or renames) file1 to file2. To move a file from one place to another, use the mv command. This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so you end up with only one file rather than two. It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same directory, but giving it a different name. We are now going to move the file science.bak to your backup directory. First, change directories to your unixstuff directory (can you remember how?). Then, inside the unixstuff directory, type\\n\\nbash % mv science.bak backups/.\\n\\nType ls and ls backups to see if it has worked.\\n\\nRemoving Files and Directories\\n\\nrm (remove), rmdir (remove directory)\\n\\nTo delete (remove) a file, use the rm command. As an example, we are going to create a copy of the science.txt file then delete it. Inside your unixstuff directory, type\\n\\nbash % cp science.txt tempfile.txt Confirm the file was created: bash % ls Now delete it: bash % rm tempfile.txt % ls\\n\\nYou can use the rmdir command to remove a directory, but only if it is empty. Try to remove the backups directory. You will not be able to since Unix will not let you remove a non-empty directory.\\n\\nTo remove a non-empty directory use bash rm -rf directory\\n\\n{{< warning >}} The above command will remove the directory without confirming anything! Be extremely careful with it! {{< /warning >}}\\n\\nYou can request confirmation with bash % rm -if directory though this may be tedious. The -i option (inquire) also works for rm bash % rm -i myfile\\n\\nExercise 2B\\n\\nCreate a directory called tempstuff using mkdir, then remove it using the rmdir command.\\n\\nDisplaying the Contents of a File on the Screen\\n\\ncat (concatenate)\\n\\nThe cat command can show a text file\\'s contents bash % cat science.txt Be sure to use the correct path to the file. Cat can also join two text files, hence its name. bash % cat file1 file2 > file3 THe > sign is a redirection, which we will discuss later.\\n\\nclear (clear screen)\\n\\nClear the screen.\\n\\nmore\\n\\nThe command more prints the contents of a file onto the screen a page at a time. Type\\n\\nbash % more science.txt Press the [space bar] if you want to see another page. Type [q] if you want to quit reading.\\n\\nThe more command is an example of a pager, a program that \"pages\" through a text file.\\n\\nhead\\n\\nThe head command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen. bash % head science.txt Now type bash % head -5 science.txt What difference did the -5 make to the head command?\\n\\ntail\\n\\nThe tail command writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen. Clear the screen and type bash % tail science.txt How can you view the last 15 lines of the file?\\n\\nSearching the Contents of a File\\n\\nSimple Searching Using more\\n\\nUsing more, you can search through a text file for a keyword (pattern). For example, to search through science.txt for the word \\'science\\', type\\n\\nbash % more science.txt then, still in more (i.e. don\\'t press [q] to quit), type a forward slash [/] followed by the word to search no-highlight /science The more command finds and highlights the keyword. Type [n] to search for the next occurrence of the word.\\n\\ngrep (don\\'t ask why it is called grep)\\n\\ngrep is one of many standard Unix utilities. It searches files for specified words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type\\n\\nbash % grep science science.txt As you can see, grep has printed out each line containing the word science... or has it? Try typing\\n\\nbash % grep Science science.txt The grep command is case-sensitive; it distinguishes between Science and science. To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the -i option, i.e. type\\n\\nbash % grep -i science science.txt\\n\\nTo search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes (the apostrophe symbol). For example to search for spinning top, type\\n\\nbash % grep -i \\'spinning top\\' science.txt\\n\\nSome other options for grep are: -v (display those lines that do NOT match); -n (precede each matching line with the line number); and -c (print only the total count of matched lines). Try some of them and see the different results. Don\\'t forget, you can use more than one option at a time, for example, the number of lines without the words science or Science is\\n\\nbash % grep -ivc science science.txt\\n\\nwc (word count)\\n\\nA handy little utility is the wc command, short for word count. To do a word count on science.txt, type bash % wc -w science.txt To find out how many lines the file has, type bash % wc -l science.txt\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCommand Operation cp file1 file2 copy file1 and call it file2 mv file1 file2 move or rename file1 to file2 rm file remove file rmdir directory remove directory cat file display file more file display file a page at a time head file display the first few lines of a file tail file display the last few lines of file grep \\'keyword\\' file search file for keywords wc file` count number of lines/words/characters in file')]\n",

A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, running compilers etc. Examples of files:\\n\\na document (report, essay etc.)\\n\\nthe text of a program written in some high-level programming language\\n\\ninstructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable or binary file)\\n\\na directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files\\n\\nThe Directory Structure\\n\\nIn Unix, folders are generally called directories. Directories are arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called root.\\n\\nListing Files and Directories\\n\\nls (list)\\n\\nWhen you first log in, your current working directory is your home directory. Your home directory has the same name as your username, for example, mst3k, and it is where your personal files and subdirectories are saved. To find out what is in your home directory, type % ls This is short for \"list.\" Most Unix commands are two to four letters, sometimes with unintuitive meanings.\\n\\nThe ls command lists the contents of your current working directory. There may be no files visible in your home directory, in which case the prompt will be returned. Alternatively, there may already be some files or folders created when your account was set up.\\n\\nIn most Unix systems, ls does not report hidden files by default. Files or directories with names beginning with a dot (.) are hidden and usually contain important program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change them unless you understand what you are doing. To list all files in your home directory including those whose names begin with a dot, type % ls -a The -a is an example of a command-line option. The options change the behavior of the command. There are online manual pages that tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behavior of the command.\\n\\nMaking Directories\\n\\nmkdir (make directory)\\n\\nWe will now make a subdirectory in your home directory to hold the files you will be creating and using in the course of this tutorial. To make a subdirectory called unixstuff in your current working directory type % mkdir unixstuff To see the directory you have just created, type % ls\\n\\nChanging to a Different Directory\\n\\ncd (change directory)\\n\\nThe command cd _directory_ means change the current working directory to \"directory\". The current working directory may be thought of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the directory tree. To change to the directory you have just made, type % cd unixstuff\\n\\nType ls to see the directory\\'s contents (it should be empty).\\n\\nExercise 1A\\n\\nMake another directory inside the unixstuff directory called backups.\\n\\nThe Directories . and ..\\n\\nWhile still in the unixstuff directory, type % ls -a The unixstuff directory (and in all other directories) contains two special directories called (.) and (..). In Unix, (.) means the current directory, so typing % cd . means stay where you are (the unixstuff directory). This may not seem very useful at first, but using (.) as the name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later in the tutorial. (..) means the parent of the current directory, so typing % cd .. will take you one directory up the hierarchy. Try it now.\\n\\nNote: there is a space between cd and the dot or double dot. Also note: typing cd with no argument always returns you to your home directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system.\\n\\nPathnames\\n\\npwd (print working directory)\\n\\nPathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole filesystem. For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your home directory, type cd to get back to your home directory and then type bash % pwd Most of the time you should see /home/mst3k. On a multiuser central system like Rivanna, /home may be a symbolic link, i.e. an alias, for something else. To see it, type bash % pwd -P The full pathname may look something like this: /sfs/qumulo/qhome/mst3k.\\n\\nExercise 1B\\n\\nUse the commands ls, pwd and cd to explore the file system. (Remember, if you get lost, type cd with no argument to return to your home directory.)\\n\\nMore About Home Directories and Pathnames\\n\\nUnderstanding Paths\\n\\nFirst type cd to get back to your home directory, then type bash % ls unixstuff to list the contents of your unixstuff directory. Now type bash % ls backups You will get a message like this: backups: No such file or directory The reason is that \"backups\" is not in your current working directory. To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory (the directory you are currently in), you must either cd to the correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your backups directory, you must type bash % ls unixstuff/backups This path starts from the current location. A path may be absolute or relative. An absolute path starts from the root location. The absolute path is bash ls /home/mst3k/unixstuff/backups\\n\\nA relative path starts from the current working directory. The special symbols . and .. are often used for relative paths.\\n\\n~ (your home directory)\\n\\nHome directories can also be referenced by the tilde ~ character. It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing bash % ls ~/unixstuff will list the contents of your unixstuff directory, no matter where you currently are in the file system. What do you think bash % ls ~ would list? What do you think % ls ~/.. would list?\\n\\nGetting Help\\n\\nOnline Manuals\\n\\nThere are online manuals which give information about most commands. The manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. Type man command to read the manual page for a particular command. For example, to find out more about the wc (word count) command, type bash % man wc In newer Linux systems, most commands have a --help option bash % wc --help However, man sends output through a pager, whereas --help prints directly to the console.\\n\\nAnother useful command, % whatis wc gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any information about options, etc.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCommand Operation ls list files and directories ls -a list all files and directories mkdir make a directory cd directory change to directory cd change to home directory cd ~ change to home directory cd .. change to parent directory pwd display the path of the current directory man display the manual pages for the specified command whatis display a description of the specified command')]\n",

The same applies to filenames, so myfile.txt, MyFile.txt and MYFILE.TXT are three separate files. Beware if copying files to a PC, since DOS and Windows do not make this distinction.\\n\\nIntroduction to the Unix Operating System\\n\\nAn operating system is the suite of programs that make the computer work. Historically, Unix had two \"flavors,\" System V from AT&T\\'s Bell Labs, and BSD (for Berkeley Software Distribution). Today that distinction is less relevant but the dominant versions of Unix still have different roots. Linux, used for some workstations and many high-performance computing clusters, arose from System V. Mac OS was derived from a version of BSD. Android is a heavily-modified Linux.\\n\\nThe \"windowing\" (graphical) system on Linux is called X11. Modern Linux systems all provide at least one \"desktop\" environment, similar to Windows or the Mac OS desktop. However, working at the command line is still often the most efficient use of teh system, so users can benefit by learning their way around a terminal.\\n\\nA Unix operating system is made up of three parts: the kernel, the shell and the programs (applications or \"apps\").\\n\\nThe Kernel\\n\\nThe kernel of Unix is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filesystem and communications in response to system calls.\\n\\nThe Shell\\n\\nThe shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt. The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different shells on the same machine. The bash shell is the default on Linux. Mac OS formerly used bash, but on newer releases the zsh shell is the default. Most of the basic commands are the same.\\n\\nAs an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, suppose a user types rm myfile to delete the file myfile. The shell searches the filesystem, first for the file containing the program rm, and directs the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on myfile. When the process rm myfile has finished, the shell then returns the prompt to the user, indicating that it is ready for further commands.\\n\\nSome Features\\n\\nFilename Tab Completion: By typing part of the name of a command, filename or directory and pressing the [Tab] key, the shell will complete the rest of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with those letters you have typed, it will halt, prompting you to type a few more letters before pressing the [Tab] key again.\\n\\nBoth bash and zsh support tab completion, but zsh has a somewhat more sophisticated set of features.\\n\\nHistory: The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list or typehistory for a list of previous commands.\\n\\nSeveral discussions of the differences between bash and zsh are available online, such as here. The rest of these tutorials are targeted to bash.\\n\\nPrompt\\n\\nThe prompt is a character or string of characters that indicates the shell is ready for a command. It varies by shell and system, and can be customized by more advanced users. Throughout these tutorials we will us the percent sign % as the prompt.')]\n",

However, you still need to provide a “framework” for the algorithm. The framework provides the algorithm with tools for performing the learning.\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/deep-learning-distributed/img/ml_overview.png caption=\"\" width=75% height=75% >}}\\n\\nDeep Learning vs Machine Learning\\n\\nDeep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that differentiates itself from ML algorithms based on the methods (neural networks) it uses to solve problems.\\n\\nAny deep learning algorithm would reiterate and perform a task repeatedly, improving a bit every time, in order to improve the outcome.\\n\\nA deep learning program builds the feature set by itself without supervision and domain expertise.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning is not only faster, but it is usually more accurate.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning needs access to immense amounts of data and compute power and takes much longer to train, but it is much faster to run tests.\\n\\nML algorithms have superior interpretability and are favorable for small amounts of data.\\n\\nML works only with sets of structured and semi-structured data, while deep learning works with both structured and unstructured data\\n\\nLimitations and Challenges\\n\\nDL models learn through observations. Outcome is not ”generalizable” if data was small or if its scope was limited.\\n\\nIf a model trains on data that contains biases, the model will reproduce those biases in its predictions.\\n\\nIf the learning rate is too high, then the model will converge too quickly, producing a less-than-optimal solution.

A warp is a unit of 32 threads. NVIDIA GPUs impose a limit of 1024 threads per block. Some integral number of warps are grouped into a streaming multiprocessor (SM) and there are tens of SMs per GPU. Each thread has its own memory and there is limited shared memory between a block of threads. Finally, there is also the global memory which is accessible to each grid or collection of blocks.\\n\\nVendors and Types\\n\\nNVIDIA, AMD, Intel\\n\\nDatacenter : K80, P100, V100, A100, H100 (NVIDIA); MI300A, MI300X (AMD)\\n\\nWorkstations: A6000, Quadro (NVIDIA)\\n\\nGaming: GeForce RTX 20xx, 30xx, 40xx (NVIDA), Radeon (AMD)\\n\\nLaptops and desktops: GeForce (NVIDIA), Radeon (AMD), Iris (Intel)\\n\\nProgramming GPUs\\n\\nSeveral libraries and programming models have been developed to program GPUs.\\n\\nCUDA\\n\\nCUDA is a parallel computation platform, developed by NVIDIA, for general-purpose programming on NVIDIA hardware.\\n\\nHIP\\n\\nHIP is a programming interface from AMD that allows developers to target either NVIDIA or AMD hardware.\\n\\nOpenCL\\n\\nOpenCL is a more general parallel computing platform, developed by Apple.

Using an A100 GPU for a job that could be handled sufficiently by a P100 GPU might lead to underutilization.\\n\\nYou may be training deep learning models while only using a single CPU core. Frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow often show significant performance benefits when multiple CPU cores are utilized for data loading.\\n\\nYou may be using too many GPUs for a job.

Minimizing the \"time to finish\" is minimizing both the time the job spends running on the compute node and the time spend waiting in the queue.\\n\\nDistributed training is imperative for larger and more complex models/datasets. Data parallelism is a relatively simple and effective way to accelerate training.\\n\\nHowever, if you are effectively using the GPU then you may consider running on multiple GPUs. For more, look into how to conduct a scaling analysis.\\n\\nData vs Model Parallelism\\n\\nThere are two ways to distribution computation across multiple devices.\\n\\n{{< rawhtml >}}\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/deep-learning-distributed/img/data_parallelism.png width=60% height=60% >}} {{< figure src=/notes/deep-learning-distributed/img/model_parallelism.png width=60% height=60% >}}\\n\\n{{< /rawhtml >}}\\n\\nData parallelism: A single model gets replicated on multiple devices. Each processes different batches of data, then they merge their results. * The single-program, multiple data (SPMD) paradigm is used. That is, the model is copied to each of the GPUs. The input data is divided between the GPUs evenly. After the gradients have been computed they are averaged across all the GPUs. This is done in a way that all replicas have numerically identical values for the average gradients. The weights are then updated and once again they are identical by construction. The process then repeats with new mini-batches sent to the GPUs. * For additional information: https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/img_5ca570946ee1c.png * There exists many variants, and they differ in how the different model replicas merge results, in whether they stay in sync at every batch or whether they are more loosely coupled, etc.\\n\\nModel parallelism: Different parts of a single model run on different devices, processing a single batch of data together. * This works best with models that have a naturally-parallel architecture, such as models that feature multiple branches.\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Data Parallelism | Model Parallelism | | ----------- | ----------- | |Allows to speed up training | All workers train on different data | |All workers have the same copy of the model | Neural network gradients (weight changes) are exchanged| |Allows for a bigger model | All workers train on the same data| | Parts of the model are distributed across GPUs | Neural network activations are exchanged | {{< /table >}}\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/deep-learning-distributed/img/dp_pcie.png caption=\"Datal loading and gradient averaging share communication resources → congestion\" width=60% height=60% >}}\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/deep-learning-distributed/img/dp_nvlink.png caption= \"Datal loading on PCIe, gradient averaging on NVLINK → no congestion\" width=60% height=60% >}}\\n\\nTensorflow Example: Synchronous Data Parallelism\\n\\nThis guide focuses on data parallelism, in particular synchronous data parallelism, where the different replicas of the model stay in sync after each batch they process. Synchronicity keeps the model convergence behavior identical to what you would see for single-device training.\\n\\nIn TensorFlow we use the tf.distribute API to train Keras models on multiple GPUs. There are two setups:\\n\\nSingle host, multi-device training. This is the most common setup for researchers and small-scale industry workflows.\\n\\nMulti-worker distributed training. This is a setup for large-scale industry workflows, e.g. training high-resolution image classification models on tens of millions of images using 20-100 GPUs.\\n\\nSingle Host, Multi GPUs\\n\\nEach device will run a copy of your model (called a replica ).\\n\\nAt each step of training: * The current batch of data (called global batch ) is split into e.g., 4 different sub-batches (called local batches ). * Each of the 4 replicas independently processes a local batch; forward pass, backward pass, outputting the gradient of the weights. * The weight updates from local gradients are merged across the 4 replicas.\\n\\nIn practice, the process of synchronously updating the weights of the model replicas is handled at the level of each individual weight variable. This is done through a mirrored variable object.\\n\\nCoding: General Steps\\n\\nDesign the Model\\n\\nRead in the data (recommended to use tf.data)\\n\\nCreate a Mirrored Strategy\\n\\nOpen a Strategy Scope\\n\\nTrain the Model\\n\\nEvaluate the Model\\n\\nDisplay the results\\n\\nActivity: Distributed TensorFlow Program\\n\\nMake sure that you can run the TF code: * TF_CNN_MultiGPU.ipynb\\n\\nPytorch Example: Data Parallel\\n\\nhttps://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html\\n\\nMulti-GPU, Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/deep-learning-distributed/img/dpp.png caption=\"Source: https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/img_5ca570946ee1c.png\" width=75% height=75% >}}\\n\\nDo not use DataParallel (increased overhead, runs on threads) in PyTorch for anything since it gives poor performance relative to DistributedDataParallel (runs on processes).\\n\\nPytorch\\'s Model Parallel Best Practices: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/model_parallel_tutorial.html\\n\\nDistributed Data Parallel video in pytorch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TibQO_xv1zc\\n\\nDDP is only applied when training, no effect during validation or evaluation\\n\\nDataParallel is very easy to use and handles * everything for you, but not optimized DDP involves more coding and adjustments, but more code optimized and hence significant speedup, more salable to multiple machines and flexibility.\\n\\nCoding: General Steps\\n\\nDesign the Model\\n\\nSet up the Ranks\\n\\nRead in the Data\\n\\nTrain the Model\\n\\nEvaluate the Model\\n\\nActivity: Distributed PT Program\\n\\nMake sure that you can run the PT code:\\n\\nPT_CNN_MultiGPU.py\\n\\nPT_CNN_MultiGPU.slurm\\n\\nPytorch Lightning Example: Data parallel\\n\\nhttps://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html\\n\\nPyTorch Lightning\\n\\nPyTorch Lightning wraps PyTorch to provide easy, distributed training done in your choice of numerical precision.\\n\\nTo convert from PT to PTL: * Restructure the code by moving the network definition, optimizer and other code to a subclass of L.LightningModule. * Remove .cuda() and .to() calls since Lightning code is hardware agnostic\\n\\nOnce these changes have been made one can simply choose how many nodes or GPUs to use and Lightning will take care of the rest.

Please do not use your local computer to write them, as they may not work. You must also use a text editor and not a word-processing program.\\n\\nSeveral options are available to prepare batch scripts.\\n\\nGraphical Editors\\n\\nYou can log in to a FastX, which provides a MATE desktop environment. One of the tools is a graphical editor very similar to Notepad. It is called pluma by MATE, but we have made it available as gedit if started from a terminal. If you wish to start it from a menu, it is available from Applications→Accessories.\\n\\nYou can also use Open OnDemand\\'s built-in file manager and editor. Create a new file from the Files menu. Select the file and choose Edit from the three-dot dropdown menu to the right of the file name. This will open a very basic text editor.\\n\\nCommand-Line Editors\\n\\nEditors available at the command line are nano, vim, and emacs. Nano is a simple text-only editor. Vim is also available text-only from a command line, but a graphical version called gvim can be invoked from a MATE Desktop through the Applications→Accessories menu. Emacs can also be started from the Accessories menu but, if a graphical environment, will start a graphical user interface. If invoked within a text-only environment, it will fall back to a text interface.\\n\\nOpen OnDemand Tool\\n\\nFor a user-friendly introduction to creating Slurm scripts on-demand, we have implemented a Slurm script generator on Open OnDemand. To access the generator, go through Utilities→Slurm Script Generator on the top bar. This will present you with a fillable web form that generates a text file in real time with the details of your resource requests. You can then download the script created by the generator to your local workstation once completed. You can upload it to the cluster using any file transfer method you prefer.\\n\\nOur First Slurm Script\\n\\nThis example illustrates the main parts of a Slurm script.\\n\\nIn a bash script, any text beyond the # is ignored.\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/hello.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nThis script runs the Python code\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/hello.py\" lang=\"python\" >}}\\n\\nThe Hello.slurm Script\\n\\nThe first line says that this script should be run by the bash interpreter. ```bash\\n\\n!/bin/bash\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe lines starting with #SBATCH are the resource requests. They are called \"pseudocomments\" since they have meaning to Slurm. There must be no space between # and SBATCH and the string must start in the first column of the line.\\n\\n```bash\\n\\nSBATCH --nodes=1\\n\\nSBATCH --ntasks=1\\n\\nSBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # total cores per task\\n\\nSBATCH --mem=32000 # mb total memory\\n\\nSBATCH --time=2:00:00\\n\\nSBATCH --partition=interactive\\n\\nSBATCH --account=hpc_training\\n\\n`` Here we are requesting * 1 node, 1 task, 1 core * 32GB of memory (measured in MB). Strictly speaking this will be \"Gibibyes.\" * 2 hours of running time. * The interactive partition (queue). A partition must be specified. * The account (allocation) grouphpc_training`\\n\\nThe next lines set up the environment to run our job. bash module purge module load miniforge\\n\\nIt is good practice to purge all modules first, since Slurm \"remembers\" any modules set in the environment where the script is launched. Next we load the module we need to run our program, the Python distribution Miniforge.\\n\\nFinally, we execute our job. bash python hello.py\\n\\nWe have chosen to name this script hello.slurm, but it can have any name.\\n\\nExercise 1\\n\\nUsing the Open OnDemand Slurm Script Generator, create a slurm script with the following resource requests: * 1 node, 1 task, 1 core. * 32GB of memory. * 2 hours of running time. * The interactive partition (queue). * The account (allocation) group hpc_training.\\n\\nUsing the displayed text file, compare your slurm script with our example hello.slurm. The requested resources should be the same. Once completed, download your slurm script and transfer it to the cluster by whatever means you wish. Also, download hello.py and transfer it to the cluster as it will be needed later.\\n\\nCommon Slurm Directives\\n\\nThe most commonly used Slurm directives are listed in the table below. Many options have two versions, one with a single hyphen - followed by one letter, or two hyphens -- followed by a word and an equals sign =. Some commands have no single-letter equivalent.\\n\\nAngle brackets < > indicate a value to be specified, and are not typed.\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Single-hyphen Option | Double-Hyphen Option| Action | | ----- | -----| ---- | | -a \\\\<list> | --array=\\\\<list> | This is a job array with parameters in \\\\<list> | | -c \\\\<ncpus> | --cpus-per-task=\\\\<ncpus> | Number of cpus (cores) to be assigned to each task.

Default unit is megabytes. | | -n \\\\<number> | --ntasks=\\\\<number> | Request a total number of tasks over all nodes allocated. | | None | --ntasks-per-node=\\\\<ntasks> | Request that a minimum of ntasks be assigned to each node. | -N \\\\<nnodes> | --nodes=\\\\<nnodes> | Request nnodes nodes. Should be used only with MPI or other protocols able to use them. | | -o \\\\<filename> | --output=\\\\<filename> | Specify a name of your choosing for the standard output file rather than the default of slurm\\\\<jobid>.out. | | -p \\\\<name>| --partition=\\\\<names> | Specify the partition to run the job. | | -t \\\\<time> | --time=\\\\<time> | Set the upper limit of the runtime. Format can be M (a number of minutes), MM:SS (minutes:seconds), HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds), D-H (days-hours), D-HH:MM (days-hours:minutes), or D-HH:MM:SS (days-hours:minutes:seconds). | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nSee also our documentation for many more examples.\\n\\nModules\\n\\nAny application software that you want to use will need to be loaded with the module load command.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n$ module load matlab $ module load miniforge $ module load goolf R Modules need to be loaded any time that a new shell is created to set up the same working environment. This includes every time that you log out and back in, and every time that you run a batch job on a compute node.\\n\\nModule Details\\n\\nmodule avail – Lists all available modules and versions.\\n\\nmodule spider – Shows all available modules\\n\\nmodule key keyword – Shows modules with the keyword in the description\\n\\nmodule list – Lists modules loaded in your environment.\\n\\nmodule load mymod – Loads the default module to set up the environment for some software.\\n\\nmodule load mymod/N.M – Loads a specific version N.M of software mymod. module load compiler mpi mymod – For compiler- and MPI- specific modules, loads the modules in the appropriate order and, optionally, the version.\\n\\nmodule purge – Clears all modules.\\n\\nLearning more about a Module\\n\\nTo locate a python module, try the following:\\n\\n$ module avail python $ module spider python $ module key python\\n\\nTo find bioinformatics software packages, try this:\\n\\n$ module key bio\\n\\nThe available software is also listed on our website\\n\\nExercise 2\\n\\nTry typing the command python in a terminal window. Why was it unable to find the executable? Now, load a module of your choosing that has python. Try the python command again. Purge your current modules and try python again.\\n\\nUse module spider R to show the available R modules and how to load them. Using this information, why does the command module load R give an error?\\n\\nOpen hello.slurm using any text editor you prefer and add the lines needed to purge existing modules, load a module that provides python, and execute the hello.py script. For reference, check our example hello.slurm.\\n\\nWorking with Files and Folders\\n\\nWhen using Slurm in terminal mode, you will probably want to create your own folders to organize your Slurm scripts, any input files, and the output. You will need to be able to move around from one folder to another at the terminal.\\n\\nBy default, Slurm will start your job from the folder in which it was launched. You can change that with the -D option (directory) but many users simply navigate to the folder and type commands.\\n\\nCreating Files and Folders\\n\\nThere are several options to create, rename, and move your files and folders. Note that folders are usually called \"directories\" in Unix.\\n\\nFastX\\n\\nUse the Caja file manager. This shows up as a filing-cabinet icon in the upper-left corner of the ribbon of the MATE Desktop. It can also be started from the menu Applications→System Tools→Caja. Caja\\'s layout is very similar in appearance and behavior to Windows Explorer and similar tools.\\n\\nOpen OnDemand\\n\\nUse the File Manager to create, rename, or move your folders.\\n\\nCommand Line\\n\\nIf you are familiar with the command line, you can use that. If you wish to learn it, you can go through our Unix Tutorials for Beginners, especially Tutorials 1--3. You can also go through our HPC from the Terminal tutorial if you have not already done so.\\n\\nChanging into a Directory\\n\\nIf you do not wish to learn the full command-line navigation, you will need to learn the cd command to get to your folder for launching your job.\\n\\nLog into a terminal in FastX, or open a terminal through the Clusters tab in Open OnDemand.\\n\\nThe cd command stands for \"change directory.\" It is followed by a path to that directory. In the examples below, mst3k is a generic user ID. Substitute your own.\\n\\nbash $cd myworkdir $cd /scratch/mstk3/myprojectdir $cd The cd command with no options returns you to the top level of your home directory.\\n\\nYou may also wish to learn pwd for \"print working directory\" so you can find out where you are.\\n\\nbash $cd shakespeare $pwd /home/mst3k/shakespeare\\n\\nExercise 3\\n\\nUse FastX or Open OnDemand or the command line to create a new folder under your scratch directory. Practice changing into and out of it. Move hello.slurm and hello.py into the newly created folder.\\n\\nUse FastX and Caja to navigate to your /scratch directory. To get there, click Go in the Caja menu. A textbox will open. Be sure that “search for files” is unchecked. Erase whatever is in the textbox and type /scratch/mst3k (substituting your own user ID). Still in FastX, open a terminal (the black box, or in the System Tools menu) and navigate to your new scratch folder.')]\n",

Some of them you can set or modify; others are set by the system. To see what is currently set in your terminal, run bash $printenv\\n\\nTo set an environment variable yourself, use the export command. bash $export VAR=value\\n\\nWhen your job starts, SLURM will initialize several environment variables. Many of them correspond to options you have set in your SBATCH preamble. Do not attempt to assign to any variable beginning with SLURM_\\n\\nSome variables that you may wish to examine or use in your scripts:\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Variable | Value | | --------- | ----- | | SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR | Directory from which the job was submitted | | SLURM_JOB_NODELIST | List of the nodes on which the job is running | | SLURM_JOB_ID | The numerical ID of the job | | SLURM_NUM_TASKS | The number of tasks (obtained from --ntasks) | | SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE | The number of tasks per node | | SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK | The number of cpus (cores) assigned to each task | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nInteractive Jobs\\n\\nMost HPC sites, including UVa\\'s, restrict the memory and time allowed to processes on the login nodes. Most jobs can be submitted through the batch system we have been discussing, but sometimes more interactive work is required. For example 1. Jobs that must be or are best run through a graphical interface, 2. Short development jobs, 3. \"Computational steering\" in which a program runs for an interval, then the output is examined and parameters may be adjusted.\\n\\nFor most of these cases, we strongly recommend the use of the Open OnDemand Interactive Applications. Jupyterlab is available to run notebooks. Rstudio and Matlab Desktop are also available to run through this interface. For more general work, including command-line options, the Desktop is usually the best option. It provides a basic terminal, but also access to other applications should they be needed.\\n\\nFor general-purpose interactive work with graphics, please use the Open OnDemand Desktop. The X11 service that Linux uses for graphics is very slow over a network. Even with a fast connection between two systems, the Desktop will perform better since the X11 server process and the programs that use it are running on the same computer.\\n\\nIf you must use a basic terminal for an interactive job, you must first use the command salloc. This is the general Slurm command to request resources. This would be followed by srun to launch the processes. However, this is complex and requires knowledge of the options, so we have provided a local \"wrapper\" script called ijob.\\n\\nijob takes options similar to those used with SBATCH, most of which are actually arguments to salloc.\\n\\nbash $ijob –c 1 –A myalloc -t <time> --mem <memory in MB> -p <partition> -J <jobname>\\n\\nWhen the job starts you will be logged in to a bash shell in a terminal on the compute node.\\n\\n{{< warning >}} Never issue an sbatch command from within an interactive job (including OOD jobs). The sbatch command must be used only to submit jobs from a login node. {{< /warning >}}\\n\\nMulticore and Multinode Jobs\\n\\nOne of the advantages of using a high-performance cluster is the ability to use many cores and/or nodes at once. This is called parallelism. There are three main types of parallelism.\\n\\nYou should understand whether your program can make use of more than one core or node before you request multiple cores and/or nodes. Special programming is required to enable these capabilities. Asking for multiple cores or nodes that your program cannot use will result in idle cores and wasted SUs, since you are charged for each core-hour. The seff command can help with this.\\n\\nHigh Throughput Serial Parallelism\\n\\nHigh throughput parallelism is when many identical jobs are run at once, each on a single core. Examples can include Monte-Carlo methods, parameter searches, image processing on many related images, some areas of bioinformatics, and many others. For most cases of this type of parallelism, the best Slurm option is a job array.\\n\\nWhen planning a high-throughput project, it is important to keep in mind that if the individual jobs are very short, less than roughly 15-30 minutes each, it is very inefficient to run each one separately, whether you do this manually or through an array. In this case you should group your jobs and run multiple instances within the same job script. Please contact us if you would like assistance setting this up.\\n\\nMulticore (Threaded)\\n\\nShared-memory programs can use multiple cores but they must be physically located on the same node. The appropriate Slurm option in this case is -c (equivalent to cpus-per-task). Shared memory programs use threading of one form or another.\\n\\nExample Slurm script for a threaded program: {{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/multicore.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nMultinode (MPI)\\n\\nIn this type of parallelism, each process runs independently and communicates with others through a library, the most widely-used of which is MPI. Distributed memory programs can run on single or multiple nodes and often can run on hundreds or even thousands of cores. For distributed-memory programs you can use the -N option to request a number of nodes, along with ntasks-per-node to schedule a number of processes on each of those nodes.\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/multinode.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nHybrid MPI plus Threading\\n\\nSome codes can run with distributed-memory processes, each of which can run in threaded mode. For this, request --ntasks-per-node=NT and cpus-per-task=NC, keeping in mind that the total number of cores requested on each node is then $NT \\\\times NC$.\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/hybrid.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nGPU Jobs\\n\\nWe have a dedicated partition with nodes that are equipped with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Code must be built to take advantage of GPU resources. If the packages and your code are not written to use GPU resources, the GPUs will remain idle and you will be charged the SUs for them. Some popular Python packages that you could use are Pytorch or TensorFlow. We have some material on how to get started with using them in a Deep Learning setting.\\n\\nGPU job scripts are similar to CPU scripts, but do require the addition of the --gres=gpu option. Example Slurm script requesting 1 GPU:\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/gpu.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nThe script uses the command nvidia-smi which detects GPU activity.\\n\\nWe have several different GPU types equipped on our nodes each offering varying amounts of memory. See our website for Hardware Specifications. In the example above, Slurm will choose whatever GPU is available. If you are working with larger models you may find that you need a GPU with more memory. To request a specific GPU, you add it to the gres Slurm option. If a GPU type has multiple options (for instance, we offer 40GB and 80GB A100 GPUs), there will be a constraint you can use to specify even further. Example Slurm script requesting 1 80GB A100 GPU node:\\n\\n{{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/gpua100.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nNote that the more specific your request is, the longer you will likely have to wait for the resource to be available.\\n\\nJob Arrays\\n\\nMany similar jobs can be submitted simultaneously through job arrays. There are some restrictions:\\n\\nIt must be a batch job.\\n\\nJob arrays should be explicitly named with -J\\n\\nIt is generally prudent to separate stdout and stderror with -o and -e\\n\\nA job array is submitted with sbatch --array=<range>, where range is two digits separated by a hyphen. bash $sbatch --array=0-30 myjobs.sh An increment can be provided bash $sbatch --array=1-7:2 myjobs.sh This will number them 1, 3, 5, 7\\n\\nIt is also possible to provide a list bash $sbatch --array=1,3,4,5,7,9 myjobs.sh\\n\\nEach job will be provided an environment variable SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID and each task will be assigned a SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID. The ARRAY_JOB_ID is the overall jobid, whereas the ARRAY_TASK_ID will take on the values of the numbers in the specified range or list.\\n\\nSlurm also provides two variables %A (global array ID) and %a (array task ID) which can be used in the -o and -e options. If they are not used, then the different tasks will attempt to write to the same file, which can result in garbled output or file corruption, so please use them if you wish to redirect streams with those options.\\n\\nTo prepare a job array, set up any input files using appropriate names that will correspond to the numbers in your range or list, e.g. myinput.0.in myinput.1.in ... myinput.30.in You would submit a job for the above files with bash $sbatch --array=0-30 In your Slurm script you would use a command such as bash python myscript.py myinput.${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.in\\n\\nThe script should be prepared to request resources for one instance of your program.\\n\\nComplete example array job script: {{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/array.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}}\\n\\nTo cancel an entire array, cancel the global ID bash scancel 1283839 You can also cancel individual tasks bash scancel 1283839_11\\n\\nUseful Commands\\n\\nWhen you submit a job and it doesn\\'t start or fails for an unknown reason it could be due to restraints in your account. This could include running out of storage space or SUs on your allocation. Additionally, it\\'s useful to see how busy the queue is. The following subsections highlight how to identify these problems.\\n\\nAllocations\\n\\nSometimes it’s useful to check how many SUs are still available on your allocation. The allocations command displays information on your allocations and how many SUs are associated with them:\\n\\n$ allocations Account Balance Reserved Available ----------------- --------- --------- --------- hpc_training 1000000 0 999882\\n\\nrunning allocations -a <allocation_name> provides even more detail on when the allocation was last renewed and its members. E.g.\\n\\n``` $ allocations -a hpc_training Description StartTime EndTime Allocated Remaining PercentUsed Active\\n\\nnew 2024-05-29 17:33:13 2025-05-29 1000000.000 999881.524 0.01 True\\n\\nName Active CommonName EmailAddress DefaultAccount\\n\\n. . . ```\\n\\nStorage Quota\\n\\nOne way to check your storage utilization is with the hdquota command. This command will show you how much of your home, scratch, and leased (if applicable) storage are being utilized. Below is the sample output for hdquota:\\n\\n$ hdquota Type Location Name Size Used Avail Use% ==================================================================================================== home /home mst3k 50G 16G 35G 32% Scratch /scratch mst3k 12T 2.0T 11T 17%\\n\\nThis is a useful command to check whether you’re running out of storage space or to see where files need to be cleaned up. For more detailed information on disk utilization you may also use the du command to investigate specific directories.\\n\\nQueue limits and Usage\\n\\nTo gain information on the different queues you can use the qlist command. This will show the list of partitions, their usage, and the SU charge rate. You can use qlimits for information on each queue’s limits.\\n\\nThe sinfo command will provide some more detailed information on the health of each queue and the number of active nodes available. These commands can be useful in diagnosing why a job may not be running, or to better understand the queue usage for more efficient job throughput. More information on hardware specifications and queue information can be found here on our website.\\n\\nNeed Help\\n\\nResearch Computing is ready to help you learn to use our systems efficiently.

Usually it is written in bash.\\n\\nResources include the quantity of time requested, the amount of memory, the number of cores per node, and if appropriate the number of nodes or the number and/or architecture of GPU.\\n\\nIn the abstract, a queue is a sequence of jobs to be prioritized and handled. In a cluster, a queue, which Slurm calls a partition, is implemented with a group of compute nodes that provide a particular set of resources.\\n\\nSlurm is a software package that manages the resources of the cluster and balances the demands of many competing job requests. It consists of a workload manager, often called a scheduler, and a slurmd \"daemon\" which runs on each node and handles the execution and monitoring of the jobs.\\n\\nCores, Nodes, and Tasks\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nThe Slurm model is a cluster consisting of a number of nodes. Each node is a separate server. These servers are similar to an ordinary desktop computer, but are more reliable and usually provide more memory and cores that an ordinary desktop.\\n\\nA core is a computing unit. It is part of a cpu.\\n\\n{{< alert >}} Slurm began when cpus had only one core each. Beginning around 2005, cpus began to be divided into multiple cores. But Slurm still refers to cores as \"cpus.\" {{< /alert >}}\\n\\nMemory refers to random-access memory. It is not the same thing as storage. If a process reports running out of memory, it means RAM memory. Running out of disk space will result in a different error.\\n\\nFor more details about the structure of a computational cluster, see our introduction.\\n\\nProcesses and Tasks\\n\\nA process can be envisioned an instance of an executable that is running on a particular computer. Most executables run only a single process. Some executables run threads within the root process.\\n\\nSlurm refers to the root process as a task. By default, each task is assigned to one core.\\n\\nSlurm Resource Requests\\n\\nSLURM refers to queues as partitions . We do not have a default partition; each job must request one explicitly.\\n\\n{{< table >}} | Queue Name | Purpose | Job Time Limit | Max Memory / Node / Job | Max Cores / Node | | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | | standard | For jobs on a single compute node | 7 days | 1462 GB | 96 | | gpu | For jobs that can use general purpose GPU’s (A40,A100,A6000,V100,RTX3090) | 3 days | 1953 GB | 128 | | parallel | For large parallel jobs on up to 50 nodes (<= 1500 CPU cores) | 3 days | 750 GB | 96 | | interactive | For quick interactive sessions (up to two RTX2080 GPUs) | 12 hours | 216 GB | 96 | {{< /table >}}\\n\\nTo see an online list of available partitions, from a command line type bash $qlist\\n\\nA more detailed view of the partitions and their limits is available through the command bash $qlimits\\n\\nBatch Scripts\\n\\nJobs are described to the resource manager in the form of a script. Typically this is written in the bash scripting language. Bash is the default shell on most Linux-based systems, which includes the majority of HPC systems, so it is expected to be available to interpret the script. However, Slurm accepts scripts in other languages if the interpreter is available. We will consider only bash scripts in this tutorial.\\n\\nTo prepare a job, the user writes a script. The top of the script is a preamble that describes the resource requests. The rest of the script contains the instructions to execute the job. The script is then submitted to the Slurm system. The Slurm workload manager examines the preamble to determine the resources needed, while ignoring the rest of the script. It uses the resource request along with a fair share algorithm to set the priority of the job. The job is then placed into the requested partition to wait for the resources to become available.\\n\\nOnce the job starts, the slurmd daemon runs the script as an ordinary shell script. The preamble consists of comments (code that is not executed by the interpreter) so they are ignored. The rest of the script must be a valid bash shell script.')]\n",

You should keep copies of your programs and data in more permanent locations such as your home directory, leased storage such as /project or /standard, or on your lab workstation. After your jobs finish, copy the results to permanent storage. {{< /alert >}}\\n\\nSubmitting a Job\\n\\nOnce we have navigated to the desired working directory in a terminal window, we use the sbatch command to submit the job. This assumes that your Slurm script is located in the current working directory.\\n\\nbash sbatch myjob.slurm The system returns a JOBID.\\n\\nWe do not make the script executable. The system handles that.\\n\\nbash $sbatch myjob.slurm Submitted batch job 36805 Always remember that you submit your job script and not your executable or interpreter script.\\n\\nExercise\\n\\nFrom your working directory where hello.slurm is, submit the job.\\n\\nMonitoring a Job\\n\\nOnce submitted, we can monitor our jobs.\\n\\nGraphical Interface\\n\\nThe Open OnDemand Job Viewer (Jobs tab→Active Jobs) shows a Web-based view of jobs. You can switch the dropdown between \"All Jobs\" and \"Your Jobs.\" You can also use the Filter textbox to select jobs by partition or another criterion. In the Filter textbox you can enter multiple strings, which acts as \"and.\"\\n\\nClicking the right-pointing arrow on the left side will cause a dropdown box to appear that will show the job status (Pending, Running, Completed) along with much other useful information.\\n\\nRemember that this is a Web page and you will need to reload it in order to see changes in status.\\n\\nCommand Line\\n\\nWe use the squeue command to check on jobs from the terminal.\\n\\nbash $squeue This shows all jobs. To narrow that down we can use the -u (user) option or the -p (partition) option.\\n\\nbash $squeue -u mst3k $squeue -p gpu\\n\\nJob status is indicated by * PD pending * R running * CG exiting\\n\\n```no-highlight JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME NODES NODELIST(REASON)\\n\\n36805 standard myjob.sl mst3k R 1:45 1 udc-aw38-34-l ```\\n\\nJobs should rarely be observed in the CG state. If they are caught in that state they cannot be canceled by the user. Exiting jobs will not charge for the time spent in that state.\\n\\nFor more information on a running job, similar to what you can see from the OOD Job Viewer, use the scontrol command. bash scontrol show job <jobid>\\n\\nDeleting a Job\\n\\nOpen OnDemand\\n\\nFrom the Job Viewer find your jobs. If the job is pending or running, a red trash-can icon will appear under the \"Actions\" header. Click the icon. A dialog box will appear asking you to confirm the cancellation.\\n\\nCommand Line\\n\\nTo cancel a job use the scancel with the job ID. You can use squeue -u $USER to obtain your job IDs, but you must know the JID of the specific job you wish to cancel.\\n\\nbash $scancel 36805 #jobID\\n\\nBe aware that if a job fails due to a system failure the time will not be charged, but if you cancel your job, or it fails due to inadequate resource request, your allocation will be charged for the time expended.\\n\\nExercise 4\\n\\nWrite a Slurm script that requests 30 minutes of time. Submit a job that will run for at least 30 minutes. It can be some software you use; if you do not have anything set up yet, write the preamble and then add the line bash sleep 30m as the command. You won\\'t need to request a specific amount of memory. Submit this script and monitor your job’s status in the queue with squeue or the Active Jobs tab. Once it starts, get information about your job with scontrol, let it run for a minute, then cancel it with scancel. Practice with the terminal commands or the OOD GUI. Note that you will need your job’s ID for the last two commands.\\n\\n{{< spoiler text=\"Example script\" >}} {{< code-download file=\"/notes/slurm-from-cli/scripts/slow.slurm\" lang=\"bash\" >}} {{< /spoiler >}}\\n\\nExamining Your Utilization\\n\\nWhen your jobs have finished, you may wish to find out how much of the resource you utilized. Two commands can be used for this purpose, sacct and seff.\\n\\nsacct\\n\\nAs the name suggests, sacct will return accounting information about your job. It is built-in to Slurm and does not know about local policies such as SU charges, but it will show you information about the job. It only works for jobs that have ended.\\n\\nWith no options it will show output for jobs run on the current date. ```bash JobID JobName Partition Account AllocCPUS State ExitCode\\n\\n56220974 mpi.slurm parallel hpc_build 10 FAILED 9:0 56220974.ba+ batch hpc_build 5 FAILED 9:0 56220974.0 mpiheated+ hpc_build 10 FAILED 1:0 56220992 mpi.slurm standard hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56220992.ba+ batch hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56220992.0 mpiheated+ hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221184 mpi.slurm standard hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221184.ba+ batch hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221184.0 mpiheated+ hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221192 mpi.slurm standard hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221192.ba+ batch hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221192.0 mpiheated+ hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 ```\\n\\nFor a particular job, use the -j option.\\n\\n```bash $sacct -j 56221192 JobID JobName Partition Account AllocCPUS State ExitCode\\n\\n56221192 mpi.slurm standard hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221192.ba+ batch hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 56221192.0 mpiheated+ hpc_build 10 COMPLETED 0:0 ```\\n\\nFor more detail, specify the -o option and a list of fields. The list of available fields is returned by sacct -e and is lengthy. For example, if I use only one allocation I may not be interested in that field. ```bash $sacct -o jobname,jobid,ncpus,nnodes,maxrss,state,elapsed -j 56221192 JobName JobID NCPUS NNodes MaxRSS State Elapsed\\n\\nmpi.slurm 56221192 10 1 COMPLETED 00:00:34 batch 56221192.ba+ 10 1 4824K COMPLETED 00:00:34 mpiheated+ 56221192.0 10 1 108800K COMPLETED 00:00:33 ```\\n\\nThe output from sacct can be heavily customized. For more information see the documentation.\\n\\nRunning sacct puts a load on the system and can be very slow, so please use it judiciously.\\n\\nseff\\n\\nThe seff command returns information about the utilization (called the \"efficiency\") of core and memory. The output of seff will be returned in an email if you use END in Slurm\\'s emailing feature.\\n\\nbash $seff 56221192 Job ID: 56221192 Cluster: shen User/Group: mst3k/users State: COMPLETED (exit code 0) Nodes: 1 Cores per node: 10 CPU Utilized: 00:05:17 CPU Efficiency: 93.24% of 00:05:40 core-walltime Job Wall-clock time: 00:00:34 Memory Utilized: 1.04 GB (estimated maximum) Memory Efficiency: 1.18% of 87.89 GB (8.79 GB/core)\\n\\nUnder most circumstances, for a cpu-only job the \"CPU\" (core) efficiency should be around 90% or better. Please contact us if it is significantly lower than that. Note that seff may be relatively inaccurate for very short jobs.\\n\\nCore efficiency is more problematic for GPU jobs, since the key to efficient GPU utilization is maximizing the GPU computations and minimizing CPU work. Seff does not provide a GPU utilization metric at this time, but we may be able to help you if you are concerned about GPU utilization.\\n\\nIf your memory utilization is low and you have requested a specified amount, use sacct -o with at least the MaxRSS field to double-check. If you do not need as much memory as you thought, you may be able to save SUs and have a shorter queue wait time if you decrease it.\\n\\nStream Output in Slurm\\n\\nWhen running a program interactively, any output to the Unix standard streams will be printed directly to the user\\'s console window. However, programs running under the control of Slurm will not have a console attached.\\n\\nBy default, SLURM redirects both standard output and standard error to a file called slurm-<jobid>.out.\\n\\nYou can change the name of this file with the -o or --output option in your script.\\n\\n```bash\\n\\nSBATCH --output=\\n\\norbash\\n\\nSBATCH -o\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou can also separate standard-error output. Even if your program does not use standard error (not many do), Slurm uses it, so you may wish to keep that output distinct. ```bash\\n\\nSBATCH --error=\\n\\norbash\\n\\nSBATCH -e\\n\\n```\\n\\nText from standard input must be redirected from a file in your command line in the script. bash ./myexec < myinput.txt\\n\\nAs an alternative to the Slurm options, you can also redirect standard output in the usual Unix manner if you prefer. bash ./myexec < myinput.txt > myoutput.dat')]\n",

MATLAB can be used for data cleansing and processing, as well as data visualization. This tutorial will cover 1. importing data from a variety of file types and formats, 2. data cleansing and manipulation, and 3. data visualization techniques.\\n\\nDownloading the Data\\n\\nThroughout the tutorial we will be working with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Download nhanes_matlab.xlsx.\\n\\nData Import\\n\\nImporting Tabular Data\\n\\nreadtable\\n\\nCreates a table by reading column oriented data from a file\\n\\nT = readtable(filename)\\n\\nreadtable creates one variable in the table T for each column in the file filename.\\n\\nWholly numeric columns will be converted to a numeric array; a cell array will be generated from a column containing any non-numeric values.\\n\\nReadable File Formats File Extensions Delimited text files .txt, .dat, .csv Spreadsheet files .xls, .xlsb, .xlsx\\n\\nExample\\n\\ndata = readtable(\\'nhanes_matlab.xlsx\\');\\n\\nWhile readtable is capable of reading Excel files, you will need to use readmatrix if you need to specify sheet names or a range of data. Both of these functions output a table.\\n\\nImporting Data from Multiple Files\\n\\ndatastore\\n\\nRead large collections of data\\n\\nA datastore is simply a reference to a file or set of files. You tell MATLAB where to look for files with the datastore command.\\n\\nSingle File ds = datastore(filename)\\n\\nMultiple Files ds = datastore(directory)\\n\\nThe datastore ds has many properties that you can modify so that MATLAB reads your data correctly (e.g. treating -999 as a missing value instead of a numeric data point).\\n\\nDatastores are also useful if you are working with such a large amount of data that you wouldn\\'t be able to load it all into memory. With a datastore you can tell MATLAB to read in the data incrementally, whether it\\'s file by file or in 100-line chunks (MATLAB reads data in 20,000 line chunks by default).\\n\\nTo read in data using a datastore, use the read or readall commands.\\n\\nRead data incrementally data = read(ds);\\n\\nRead all data referenced by datastore ds data = readall(ds);\\n\\nSee the MATLAB documentation on datastores to learn more about customizing your data import.\\n\\nExample\\n\\n```matlab % Create datastore ds = datastore(\\'nhanes_matlab.xlsx\\');\\n\\n% Set ReadSize property in ds to 50 so we only read in 50 lines at a time ds.ReadSize = 50;\\n\\n% Read in first 50 lines data50 = read(ds);\\n\\n% Read in next 50 lines data100 = read(ds);\\n\\n% Read in all data data_all = readall(ds); ```\\n\\nImporting Unstructured Data\\n\\nSuppose you have an unstructured data file like the one below.\\n\\n{{< figure src=\"/notes/matlab-data-visualization/matlab-dataviz-1.png\" >}}\\n\\nMATLAB is unable to read data automatically if each line doesn\\'t have the same number of columns. We can use MATLAB\\'s lower-level file import functions to read irregular data.\\n\\nUsing low-level file import requires three steps:\\n\\nOpen file (fid = fopen(filename), fid stands for file ID)\\n\\nRead data\\n\\nClose file (fclose(fid))\\n\\nThe first and last steps are pretty straightforward, so the rest of this section will focus on step 2. There are a couple ways we can read in the data.\\n\\nfgetl Read line from file\\n\\nmyLine = fgetl(fid) Using in succession will allow you to continue reading the file line by line. Regardless of whether the data is numeric, the output of fgetl will be a string. This means you may have to parse and convert the data to the proper data type after import. You can learn more about this process from MATLAB\\'s documentation on string manipulation.\\n\\ntextscan Read formatted data from file\\n\\nmyData = textscan(fid, formatSpec)\\n\\ntextscan allows you to specify the format of a line of data up-front so that you don\\'t have to manipulate strings unnecessarily. textscan also allows you to read multiple lines and to skip any columns you don\\'t need.\\n\\nThe output of textscan is a cell array (myData) where each cell contains the values from a single column. Each cell will contain a column vector (for numeric data) or column cell array (for non-numeric or mixed data).\\n\\ntextscan requires you to specify the format of your data in the variable formatSpec. Below is a formatSpec for some example data.\\n\\n{{< figure src=\"/notes/matlab-data-visualization/matlab-dataviz-2.png\" >}}\\n\\n```matlab % This dataset is part of your installation of MATLAB!\\n\\n% fullfile retrieves the full file path to the dataset. filename = fullfile(matlabroot, \\'examples\\', \\'matlab\\', \\'scan1.dat\\');\\n\\n% Open the file fid = fopen(filename);\\n\\n% Format spec: it\\'s a string formatSpec = \\'%{MM/dd/uuuu}D %s %f32 %d8 %u %f %f %s %f\\';\\n\\n% Read the data into using textscan myData = textscan(fid, formatSpec);\\n\\n% Close the file fclose(fid); ```\\n\\nMore information about MATLAB\\'s low-level file I/O can be found here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/low-level-file-i-o.html.\\n\\nData Cleansing\\n\\nWorking with Missing Data\\n\\nWhen MATLAB imports data that has missing values for numeric variables, it replaces that instance with NaN, or Not-a-Number. This section discusses multiple ways you can handle missing data and NaNs.\\n\\nOmitting NaNs\\n\\nCalculating statistics on arrays that contain NaN results in another NaN. If we want to omit NaNs from our calculation, we can use the \\'omitnan\\' option.\\n\\nExample: Calculating mean ``` avgIncome = mean(data.Income, \\'omitnan\\');\\n\\n```\\n\\nOther functions that can use the \\'omitnan\\' option:\\n\\nFunction Name What It Does cov Covariance mean Mean median Median std Standard Deviation var Variance\\n\\nHowever, max and min omit NaNs by default, and adding the \\'omitnan\\' flag will yield unexpected results.\\n\\nLocating Missing Data and Deleting Incomplete Rows\\n\\nismissing Find missing values in a table\\n\\nTF = ismissing(A) ismissing returns a logical array TF that is the same size as the table A. Values of 1 in TF correspond to missing values in A at the same location.\\n\\nany Find non-zero elements in an array\\n\\nmissingRows = any(TF, 2) any returns a logical array missingRows that is the same length as the input array TF. Values of 1 in missingRows correspond to rows in TF that contain a 1. Because 1s in TF correspond to missing values in our original table A, values of 1 in missingRows also correspond to rows with missing data in A.\\n\\nWe have the number 2 as the second input in any. This is because by default any looks for non-zero elements in a column. Since we want to look for non-zero elements in rows, we need to specify that with the 2.\\n\\nLogical Indexing\\n\\nRemove rows with missing data\\n\\nA(missingRows,:) = [];\\n\\nUsing our logical array missingRows, we can index into our table A and select all the rows in A that have missing data. With the colon operator :, we can also select the data from all the columns in those rows. If we select that data in A and set it equal to empty brackets, that will remove all those rows from A.\\n\\nExample ``` % Read in data as table data = readtable(\\'nhanes_matlab.xlsx\\');\\n\\n% Find missing data missing = ismissing(data);\\n\\n% Find rows that have missing data missingRows = any(missing, 2);\\n\\n% Remove rows with missing data from table data(missingRows,:) = []; ```\\n\\nCategorical Data and Set Operations\\n\\ncategorical\\n\\nAssigns a value to each of a finite set of discrete categories\\n\\nConsider the cell array below. mySet = {\\'low\\', \\'medium\\', \\'low\\', \\'low\\', \\'high\\', \\'medium\\', \\'low\\'}; As humans, we understand that the array contains values that fall into 3 distinct categories: \\'low\\', \\'medium\\', and \\'high\\'. MATLAB doesn\\'t necessarily know this and will treat all seven items in the array as individual values. With the categorical function, we can tell MATLAB to treat values with the same string as part of a single category. The output of the categorical function is a categorical array the same size as the input array.\\n\\n``` mySet = categorical(mySet);\\n\\ncategories(mySet) ```\\n\\nWith the categories command, we can find out the different categories in our categorical array. As expected, our three categories are \\'low\\', \\'medium\\', and \\'high\\'.\\n\\nWe can convert the text variables in our table to categorical arrays one at a time with the categorical command.\\n\\n```matlab % Reading the data into a table data = readtable(\\'nhanes_matlab.xlsx\\');\\n\\n% Convert Gender variable to categorical array data.Gender = categorical(data.Gender); ```\\n\\nconvertvars Batch convert table variables to categorical arrays\\n\\nT2 = convertvars(T1, vars, datatype)\\n\\nWe can use convertvars to create a new table T2 that converts all the variables in our table T1 to our desired data type, in this case categorical arrays. We list the names of the variables we want to convert in the cell array vars.\\n\\nExample ```matlab % Reading the data into a table data = readtable(\\'nhanes_matlab.xlsx\\');\\n\\n% Convert text variables to categorical arrays vars = {\\'Gender\\', \\'Race\\'};\\n\\nnewdata = convertvars(data, vars, \\'categorical\\'); ```\\n\\nWe can replace vars with @iscell if we know we want to convert all cell arrays to in our table to categorical arrays.\\n\\nnewdata = convertvars(data, @iscell, \\'categorical\\');\\n\\nWhy Use Categorical Arrays?\\n\\nSeveral discrete data plot types require input data be categorical\\n\\nUse less memory\\n\\nismissing is able to determine missing data in categorical arrays but not cell arrays\\n\\nAnalyzing Groups within Data\\n\\nMATLAB Academy Exercises\\n\\nData Visualization\\n\\nWe will be looking at different examples of data visualization in MATLAB using a live script.

There are a number of version control software (VCS) systems ... Git is one of them. It\\'s a powerful tool for tracking and reconciling changes to text files from individual or multiple contributors. The basic unit of Git is the repository. Unlike some other VCS, Git tracks changes by storing snapshots of entire repository at different points in time. This is internally different from \"delta-based\" system that just keeps track of changes to the files. While Git can be used as a standalone piece of software, many people leverage web hosting platforms that expand the VCS functionality and have project management and collaborative features built in. Several examples of these services include Bitbucket, GitLab and GitHub.\\n\\nGitHub\\n\\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. The platform includes a web interface to explore files and perform version control operations, as well as a number of collaboration tools for commenting, opening requests for new features, using project management methods, social networking, creating versions of software releases, and many more. GitHub is an extremely popular service, particularly among software developers and scientists who want to share code as part of \"open source\" projects.\\n\\n1. Log into github.com\\n\\nTo begin with we\\'ll log into github.com\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t already created an account, make sure you follow the steps create one.\\n\\n2. Click the + icon and select \"New repository\"\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Give the repository a name\\n\\nLike the prompt suggests, repository names should be short and memorable. And they must be unique to your account ... i.e. you can\\'t have two repositories in your account with the same name.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Check the box to \"Initialize this repository with a README\"\\n\\nNew repositories on GitHub require contents to initialize. To get started, we can initialize with a README file, which are typically included in repositories to provide a description of content, usage and / or any necessary software setup.\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Create a new file\\n\\nGitHub provides a file editor in the browser. We\\'re going to make use of that here to demonstrate some basic concepts of version control ... but nb that editing files this way is not a typical workflow, especially if you\\'re storing versions of your code locally (on your computer) and remotely (on GitHub). More on that later ...\\n\\n``` smpl <- rnorm(1000)\\n\\nxbar <- mean(x) s <- sd(x)\\n\\nhist(smpl) ```\\n\\n6. Edit the file\\n\\n``` smpl <- rnorm(1000)\\n\\nxbar <- mean(x) s <- sd(x)\\n\\nhist(smpl) abline(v = xbar, lwd = 2, col = \"red\") abline(v = xbar + 2s, lwd = 2, col = \"red\", lty = 3) abline(v = xbar - 2s, lwd = 2, col = \"red\", lty = 3) ```\\n\\n7. Take a look at the commit history and branch explorer\\n\\n\\n\\nEach change to the repository (or commit) is recorded and tracked separately via a unique combination of characters. This hash is abbreviated in the commit history view, which provides an interface to explore the file(s) and line(s) that were changed as part of the commit.\\n\\nGitHub also provides a view of branches, which you can think of as a collection of commits that can represent an entirely different version of the repository. Ultimately, you can perform a merge operation to combine changes across branches. This can be particularly helpful for collaborations between multiple individuals or for a single developer who would like to keep the \"experimental\" features separate from stable code.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the fundamental unit of Git is the repository. The steps we\\'ve completed up until now have introduced the basics of creating, committing and tracking changes within a single repository. However, GitHub allows its users to have multiple repositories. In some cases, rather than creating a repository from scratch you might need to fork another user\\'s repository. This workflow can be useful for collaborative projects, as it essentially copies the contents and complete version control history at a single point in time.\\n\\n8. Fork a repository\\n\\nTo illustrate the idea of forking, we\\'ll need to start with an existing repository. For this exercise, we\\'ve created a repository that will include a comma separated value (.csv) file with data on our favorite foods.\\n\\nEach of us will fork this original repository ... and in doing so create new repositories with all the files and previous changes in our accounts.\\n\\nNavigate to https://github.com/uvasomrc/foods and click the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner of the page.\\n\\n\\n\\n9. Make a unique change to an existing file\\n\\nFind the line with your initials in foods.csv, and after the comma enter your favorite food. If you don\\'t find your initials in the list, feel free to add a new line with your initials and favorite food separated by a comma.\\n\\n10. Submit a Pull Request\\n\\nThe pull request mechanism allows contributors to propose changes to the owner of the upstream repository. That owner can review these changes, and conditionally accept or reject them. This process may involve ongoing dialogue and review, during which time the proposed changes can be updated by editing the forked repository.\\n\\nGit (Command Line Interface)\\n\\nThus far we\\'ve managed our version control activities using the GitHub platform, which has a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Git as a program also has a command line interface (CLI), which can be extremely useful whether you\\'re managing repositories locally or remotely. In this part of the workshop we\\'ll cover some common workflows using the Git CLI.\\n\\n1. Fork the quality/ repository\\n\\nTo motivate the Git CLI material, we\\'ve created a repository with an example python script that creates diagnostic plots of read quality scores for sequence data.\\n\\nStart by forking this repository on GitHub:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/uvasomrc/quality\\n\\n2. Confirm that git is installed and configured on your computer\\n\\nNow that you have the repository forked to your GitHub account, we\\'ll clone it locally. To work with Git on your computer, you\\'ll need it installed:\\n\\nhttps://git-scm.com/downloads\\n\\nMac has the Terminal app, and Windows has Git BASH.\\n\\nFrom the command line, confirm that Git is installed by calling it by name followed by the --version flag.\\n\\ngit --version\\n\\nIf the command above returns the version without error, then you have Git successfully installed.\\n\\nThere\\'s one more step to configure the program post-installation. Each commit is associated with an author and email address. To check if you have a globally configured username and email address use the following command:\\n\\ngit config -l\\n\\nIf you don\\'t see anything returned, then you\\'ll need to do the configuration:\\n\\ngit config --global user.name \"{YOUR_NAME_HERE}\"\\n\\ngit config --global user.email {YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE}\\n\\n3. Clone the repository\\n\\nWith Git installed and configured you are now ready to clone the repository contents and commit history to your computer.\\n\\nCloning the repository will create a new folder as a subdirectory of your current working directory. If you\\'re not sure where that is, in your terminal you can print the working directory:\\n\\npwd\\n\\nNavigate back to your repository on GitHub and find the Clone or download button, and click it to expand. Copy and paste the Clone with HTTPS link:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/{YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE}/quality\\n\\n\\n\\nUse git clone followed by the link (above):\\n\\ngit clone {CLONE_WITH_HTTPS_LINK_HERE}\\n\\n4. View the log of commits\\n\\nAfter cloning to your computer, you now have a new folder with all the files and version control history from the remote repository. You can navigate to this directory and list all the contents:\\n\\ncd quality\\n\\nls -la\\n\\nAs you can see, on your computer you now have all the files from the remote and something called .git, which is a hidden folder that includes the information that Git uses to track versions of the code.\\n\\nTo access the history of commits (starting at the point in time when you cloned the repository) use the following:\\n\\ngit log\\n\\n5. Check the status\\n\\nAs you work with the code it\\'s good practice to keep an eye on the status of your code base:\\n\\ngit status\\n\\n6. Run qcheck.py\\n\\nAs described above this repository contains code written in python (qcheck.py) ... this script loads sequence data stored in .fastq format and produces some simple diagnostic plots. The data/ folder includes some example files so you can run the script. Keep in mind you\\'ll need python, as well as the biopython and matplotlib modules installed (see README of the quality).\\n\\nWith those requirements satisfied you can execute the script as follows:\\n\\npython qcheck.py data/SRR622461_2.fastq data/SRR622461_2.fastq\\n\\n7. Edit the script and re-run it\\n\\nNow let\\'s edit the script. One parameter we might want to adjust is the number of reads plotted (see line 19 of qcheck.py) ... let\\'s try changing that from 50 to 60:\\n\\nvim qcheck.py\\n\\nRe-run the script:\\n\\npython qcheck.py data/SRR622461_2.fastq data/SRR622461_2.fastq\\n\\n8. Check the status and view the diff\\n\\nThe status of the repo will show us that we have made changes:\\n\\ngit status\\n\\nThe diff command is very useful in seeing the actual changes we\\'ve made:\\n\\ngit diff\\n\\nThe output from diff includes line-by-line additions and subtractions. For more information, refer to the resources\\n\\n9. Stage and commit the change made to qcheck.py\\n\\nLet\\'s presume we want to keep track of the edits to qcheck.py. Before we commit the changes, we need to first add (or stage) them to be committed:\\n\\ngit add qcheck.py\\n\\nCheck the status again and confirm that the edits are staged:\\n\\ngit status\\n\\nNow try using git commit followed by the file name:\\n\\ngit commit qcheck.py\\n\\nOops. That didn\\'t work ... why not?\\n\\nEvery commit requires a message specifying what and why a change was made. You must include a message passed in quotes after the -m flag. While this is technically just a \"subject line\" for the commit (you can write more descriptive message \"bodies\"), in most cases this is sufficient to annotate the changes:\\n\\ngit commit -m \"increased number of reads to be plotted and changed plot file name\"\\n\\nIt is worth noting here that Git users have varied philosophies and practices regarding writing commit messages. For more information, refer to the resources.\\n\\nThe commit we just made is associated with a unique hash, which is an alphanumeric reference for the code at the exact point time when we committed the change(s). You can refer to this hash (or an abbreviation) of it with other Git commands, and you\\'ll see it in the log:\\n\\ngit log\\n\\n10. Synchronize these changes with the repo on GitHub.com\\n\\nGiven that the repository we are working with was originally cloned from GitHub, there is a remote URL associated with the repository:\\n\\ngit remote -v\\n\\nWe can send our changes to the remote repository with a push command followed by the name of the remote (default is origin) and name of branch (default is master):\\n\\ngit push origin master\\n\\nNote that sending the commit(s) we\\'ve made up to the remote GitHub repository requires:\\n\\nAn internet connection\\n\\nAuthentication to GitHub (you need to essentially \"log in\" through the command line)\\n\\nVerification that the GitHub account you are using has permissions to update the remote repository\\n\\nIf you have a SSH (Secure Shell) key set up, you\\'ll see a message saying that the changes have been synchronized on GitHub. If not you\\'ll need to enter your GitHub username and password.\\n\\nYou can persistently associate your computer with your GitHub account (so you don\\'t have to enter your username and password every time) you can set up an SSH key:\\n\\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/\\n\\nIf you visit the remote URL, you should see the changes you made to qcheck.py, along with the hash / message associated with your commit.\\n\\nYou may have noticed that not all the files in your quality/ folder on your computer appear on GitHub. For example, the if you look in the plots/ folder on GitHub you won\\'t see the .png files ... and that\\'s intentional.\\n\\nOne of the files we\\'ve included in our repository is a .gitignore file, which serves as a relay to Git regarding what not to track. You can use wildcards (*) to exclude all files that exist in a certain subdirectory, end in a certain suffix, start with a certain prefix, etc.\\n\\nLet\\'s change gear a bit ... we\\'ll still be working with the Git CLI, but rather than starting by cloning a remote repository we\\'re going to instead initialize a new one locally.\\n\\n11. Create and initialize a new Git repository\\n\\nTo create a Git repository we first need a new directory (or folder):\\n\\ncd ..\\n\\nmkdir clock\\n\\ncd clock\\n\\nOnce we\\'ve created the clock/ folder and have changed down into it, we can run git init to initialize the folder as a Git repository:\\n\\ngit init\\n\\nFrom now on, Git will know to look for changes to files inside of clock/.\\n\\n12. Create, add and commit files for the clock\\n\\nWith the repository initialized, we will create two files (README.md and clock.sh) ... start by making empty files using touch:\\n\\ntouch README.md\\n\\ntouch clock.sh\\n\\nIs Git keeping track?\\n\\ngit status\\n\\nNow stage and commit both at once (the . stages all the files that have been changed):\\n\\ngit add .\\n\\ngit commit -m \"adding skeleton of scripts\"\\n\\ngit status\\n\\n13. Edit, add and commit the README file\\n\\nWe have two empty files that we\\'ve committed ... now let\\'s add some content.\\n\\nStart with the README:\\n\\nvim README.md\\n\\n```\\n\\nClock\\n\\nThis repository contains a script that returns the time when executed.\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nbash clock.sh ```\\n\\nNow stage the changes to README.md:\\n\\ngit add README.md\\n\\nAnd commit them:\\n\\ngit commit -m \"adding README with description and instructions\"\\n\\n14. Edit, add and commit the clock script\\n\\nclock.sh will have the actual code for our BASH program:\\n\\nvim clock.sh\\n\\n```\\n\\n!/bin/bash\\n\\nd=$(date \\'+%H:%M:%S\\'); printf \"the time is ...\\\\n$d\\\\n\" ```\\n\\ngit add clock.sh\\n\\ngit commit -m \"added the bash clock script\"\\n\\n15. Sync the local repository with a GitHub remote\\n\\nThe local Git repository we\\'ve just created is entirely independent of GitHub:\\n\\ngit remote -v\\n\\nHowever, we can associate our local repository with GitHub.\\n\\nFirst, we\\'ll need to create a new repository on GitHub. It\\'s probably a good idea to use the same name as your local repo for this.\\n\\nMake sure none of the boxes to \"initialize\" are checked on GitHub\\n\\n\\n\\nNow from the command line, we can add connect the remote we just created to our local Git repository:\\n\\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/{YOURREPONAMEHERE}\\n\\ngit push -u origin master\\n\\nWhether your on a remote or local ... a fork or upstream ... you can further organize and track code in Git with a branch structure.\\n\\n16. Create a new branch\\n\\nA branch is essentially a detour from the code base at a particular commit in history. As it turns out, we\\'ve been actually using a branch already, albeit the default master:\\n\\ngit branch -v\\n\\nTo create a new branch use git checkout with the -b flag followed by the name for the branch:\\n\\ngit checkout -b feature\\n\\nNow if we look at the branches with the -v option, we see that there is now a branch called feature:\\n\\ngit branch -v\\n\\nThe * indicates that we are \"on\" the feature branch, and all of our subsequent commits will be applied until we switch branches again.\\n\\n17. Edit, add and commit the file on the new branch\\n\\nLet\\'s modify our clock program, and add and commit those changes to this branch:\\n\\nvim clock.sh\\n\\n```\\n\\n!/bin/bash\\n\\nd=$(date \\'+%H:%M:%S\\'); printf \"the time is ...\\\\n$d\\\\nhave a nice day\\\\n\" ```\\n\\ngit add clock.sh\\n\\ngit commit -m \"adding new feature to the clock script\"\\n\\n18. Checkoutmaster again\\n\\nChange back to your original branch (master) with the following:\\n\\ngit checkout master\\n\\n19. Make a new edit, then add and commit that change\\n\\nTry modifying the same line on master as we did on feature:\\n\\nvim clock.sh\\n\\n```\\n\\n!/bin/bash\\n\\nd=$(date \\'+%H:%M:%S\\'); printf \"the time is ...\\\\n$d\\\\nhave a nice day!\\\\n\" ```\\n\\nAdd and commit the changes:\\n\\ngit add clock.sh\\n\\ngit commit -m \"adding \\'have a nice day!\\' to the clock\"\\n\\n20. Attempt to merge the changes from the feature branch\\n\\nBranching is helpful in that ultimately you can merge changes from multiple branches into one.\\n\\nBecause we are currently on the master branch, the following will attempt to merge changes from feature into master:\\n\\ngit merge feature\\n\\nHowever, as you see there is a conflict between the two branches. Using a text editor we can view and resolve this conflict:\\n\\nvim clock.sh\\n\\nExercises\\n\\nThe exercises are intended to give you a chance to explore and use the tools discussed in the morning lecture. These exercises introduce new concepts as well, and in doing so point towards various tools and documentation. Feel free to spend as much or as little time with each prompt.\\n\\n1. Learn Git Branching\\n\\nGit branching is an important and sometimes difficult concept to learn. A group of developers has created a very helpful tool for exploring how branches behave.\\n\\nGo through the Learn Git Branching exercises:\\n\\nhttps://learngitbranching.js.org/\\n\\nAlternatively, visit the sandbox to interactively make commits, create branches, merge branches, etc.:\\n\\nhttps://learngitbranching.js.org/?NODEMO\\n\\n2. Good Commit Messages\\n\\nEvery git commit requires an accompanying message. At minimum this should be a single \"subject line\" briefly describing the changes made. However, the commit message can include a \"body\" with more thorough and descriptive notes about how / why the edits were implemented. These comments are particularly useful for a future maintainer or contributor ... and that person might be you! So you can do yourself a huge favor by creating good commit messages.\\n\\nTake some time to read a blog post by developer Chris Beams titled \"How to Write a Git Commit Message\":\\n\\nhttps://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\\n\\nTry making a new commit locally to your quality/ repository. Use a commit message with a body.\\n\\n3. Syncing a Fork\\n\\nWhen you fork a repository, you bring along all the files, commits and associated version control information ... starting from the point in time when it was forked.\\n\\nAs you continue to work on your fork, the upstream repository (from which you originally forked) may or may not be static. The owner or other contributors might modify the contents, creating commits that depart from the tree structure that you are tracking.\\n\\nTo keep up with these changes you must sync the fork:\\n\\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/\\n\\nUse the documentation above to sync your fork of the foods/ repository with the upstream:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/uvasomrc/foods\\n\\n4. Create a conflict\\n\\nThe basic unit of Git is the repository. However, GitHub slightly extends to this concept in its Gist service, which essentially allows users to upload snippets of code without having to track an entire repository.\\n\\nFor this exercise, you\\'ll be working from code hosted in a GitHub Gist:\\n\\nhttps://gist.github.com/JonathanMH/397fc427842614dd4803\\n\\nStart by cloning the Gist:\\n\\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists/\\n\\ncreate_conflict.sh is a shell script that demonstrates what happens when there is a conflict in git commits. Try running it on your computer ... and if you\\'re not sure how to do that, Google it!\\n\\nMake sure you are running this script relative to a directory location (folder) that you are comfortable making a new folder called git-repo/ ... feel free to delete this folder after the exercise.\\n\\n5. GitHub Pages\\n\\nIn addition to hosting free public repositories, GitHub also provides a service to host static websites called GitHub Pages:\\n\\nhttps://pages.github.com/\\n\\nFollow the 5 steps on the GitHub Pages website to get started.\\n\\nIf you would like a more advanced example, try forking the following repo:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/onlywei/explain-git-with-d3\\n\\nForking remotely copies an upstream repository from one account to another. Because it is operating on the repository level, the fork inherits all commits and branches. In this case the explain-git-with-d3 repo includes branch named gh-pages. As a service, GitHub.com will host anything that is stored in a gh-pages branch. To access the hosted version of the contents, you can go to https://{USERNAME}.github.io/{REPOSITORYNAME}')]\n",

You can go to the Add-On Explorer to install these packages.\\n\\nUsing the Sample Dataset\\n\\nTo use the images in the sample dataset, first unzip the folder and add the folder and subfolders to your path. This will make the files visible to MATLAB.\\n\\nYou can then change directory into the DeepLearning folder. This is where we will be working for the remainder of this tutorial.\\n\\n```matlab unzip(\\'DeepLearning.zip\\') addpath(genpath(\\'DeepLearning\\'))\\n\\ncd DeepLearning ```\\n\\nExample 1. Using a Pretrained Network\\n\\nAlexNet\\n\\nAlexNet is a neural network that was developed by Alex Krizhevsky at the University of Toronto in 2012. AlexNet was trained for a week on one million images from 1000 different categories.\\n\\nIn this example we will load AlexNet into MATLAB and use it to classify some images.\\n\\n1. Load AlexNet\\n\\nLoad the pretrained network AlexNet into your MATLAB workspace as a variable net.\\n\\nmatlab net = alexnet;\\n\\n2. Load the image\\n\\nLoad the first sample image into the workspace as a variable img.\\n\\nmatlab img = imread(\\'file1.jpg\\'); Optionally, you can also view the image.\\n\\nmatlab imshow(img)\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/matlab-deep-learning/matlab-schnauzer.png >}}\\n\\n3. Resize the image\\n\\nAlexNet was trained on images that are 227 x 227 pixels in size. This means any images we want to classify with AlexNet must also be this size.\\n\\n```matlab % See the size of the image\\n\\nimgSize = size(img)\\n\\n% Resize the image\\n\\nimg = imresize(\\'img\\', [227 227]); imshow(img) ``` {{< figure src=/notes/matlab-deep-learning/matlab-schnauzer-resized.png >}}\\n\\n4. Classify the image\\n\\nThe classify function takes a neural net and an image as inputs and returns a categorical prediction as an output.\\n\\nmatlab pred = classify(net, img);\\n\\nTry classifying the other images in the SampleImages folder. What results do you get?\\n\\nExample 2. Perform Transfer Learning\\n\\nTransfer Learning\\n\\nTransfer Learning is the process of modifying a pretrained neural network to\\n\\nDatastores\\n\\nDatastores are repositories for collections of data that are too large to fit in memory. Instead of storing all the pixel data in memory, datastores allow us to store just the filepaths and to read the image data into memory as needed.\\n\\n1. Create an image datastore\\n\\nCreate an image datastore. We can label these images based on the folders in which they are organized.\\n\\nmatlab imds = imageDatastore(\\'flowers\\', \\'IncludeSubfolders\\', true, \\'LabelSource\\', \\'foldernames\\');\\n\\nWe can preview the first image in our datastore imds.\\n\\nmatlab imshow(preview(imds))\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/matlab-deep-learning/matlab-flower.png >}}\\n\\nWe can also inspect the labels of our images by extracting the Labels.\\n\\nmatlab imds.Labels\\n\\n2. Split the data\\n\\nWhen training on new data, we generally want to reserve some of the data for testing. These data will not be used in training so that we don\\'t overfit the network -- that is, so that the network isn\\'t just good at classifying images it\\'s already seen before. The test images will be used to evaluate the network\\'s performance.\\n\\nTypically we want to split our dataset into two subsets: train and test. Usually we use 80% of the data for training and use the remaining 20% for testing.\\n\\nThe splitEachLabel function allows us to divide the data proportionally within each folder/label. By default, splitEachLabel will split the images based on alphabetical order, so we can use the \\'randomized\\' option to randomly assign images to the training and test sets.\\n\\nmatlab [train, test] = splitEachLabel(imds, 0.8, \\'randomized\\');\\n\\n3. Modify layers of AlexNet\\n\\nAlexNet is made of 25 distinct layers. We can inspect these layers by looking at the Layers attribute of net (the variable in which we loaded AlexNet).\\n\\nmatlab layers = net.Layers\\n\\nLayer 1 is the input layer, which is where we feed our images.\\n\\nLayers 2-22 are mostly Convolution, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and Max Pooling layers. This is where feature extraction occurs.\\n\\nLayer 23 is a Fully Connected Layer containing 1000 neurons. This maps the extracted features to each of the 1000 output classes.\\n\\nLayer 24 is a Softmax Layer. This is where a probability is assigned to the input image for each output class.\\n\\nLayer 25 returns the most likely output class of the input image.\\n\\nWhen starting with a pretrained network, we typically want to modify just the last few layers to suit our particular problem. The feature extraction layers will adjust themselves based on the images we are training on -- no need to modify them ourselves!\\n\\nFirst, we want to create a new Fully Connected layer fc with 5 neurons -- one for each of our flower labels. We will then replace the Fully Connected layer in layers with fc.\\n\\nmatlab fc = fullyConnectedLayer(5); layers(23) = fc;\\n\\nWe also want to replace the last layer with a new classification layer.\\n\\nmatlab layers(end) = classificationLayer;\\n\\n4. Set the training options\\n\\nNow we want to train the network with our training data and new layers. Before we begin training, we want to set our training options, or hyperparameters.\\n\\nMore documentation about the different options can be found here.\\n\\nTraining Option Description Solver Name The solver for the training network. MATLAB allows us to use different optimizers: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum sdgm , RMSProp rmsprop , and Adam adam . MiniBatchSize Size of the mini-batch used for each training iteration. Rather than train the network on the whole training set for each iteration, we can train on mini-batches, or subsets of the data. MaxEpochs Number of times the training algorithm passes over the entire training set. Shuffle Optional shuffling of the training data. Shuffling the training data allows you to train over different mini-batches for each epoch. InitialLearnRate This controls how we quickly the network adapts. Larger learning rates mean the network makes bigger adjustments after each iteration. A rate that is too large can cause the network to converge at a suboptimal solution, while a rate that is too small can make the network learn too slowly. Verbose Set to true if you want progress printed to the Command Window. Plots Display training progress plots with the training-progress option.\\n\\nWe can set our desired training options in a variable called options using the trainingOptions function.\\n\\n```matlab options = trainingOptions(\\'sgdm\\', ... \\'MiniBatchSize\\', 10, ... \\'MaxEpochs\\', 2, ... \\'InitialLearnRate\\', 3e-4, ... \\'Shuffle\\', \\'every-epoch\\', ... \\'Verbose\\', false, ... \\'Plots\\', \\'training-progress\\');\\n\\n```\\n\\n5. Train the network\\n\\nNow that we have our options set we can begin training the network on our new dataset. We will call our new neural network flwrnet.\\n\\nWe will use the trainNetwork function to train the network. As inputs, we will use our training dataset train, our modified layers layers, and our training options options.\\n\\nmatlab flwrnet = trainNetwork(train, layers, options);\\n\\nIt will take several minutes to train the network.\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/matlab-deep-learning/matlab-training-progress.png >}}\\n\\n6. Evaluating performance\\n\\nAfter training has completed, we can evaluate the performance of the network flwrnet using the reserved test dataset test.\\n\\n```matlab % Classify our test dataset\\n\\npreds = classify(flwrnet, test);\\n\\n% Extract the actual labels of the test dataset\\n\\nactual = test.Labels;\\n\\n% Count the number of predictions that match the actual label\\n\\nnumCorrect = nnz(preds == actual);\\n\\n% Determine the fraction of correct predictions\\n\\nfracCorrect = numCorrect/length(actual) ```\\n\\nWe can also create a Confusion Matrix Chart, which shows us the number of correct predictions for each output class. The confusion matrix also shows us the breakdown of how incorrect predictions were classified.\\n\\nmatlab confusionchart(actual,preds)\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/matlab-deep-learning/matlab-confusion-matrix.png >}}\\n\\n7. Improving Performance\\n\\nWith our initial training options, our resulting network has so-so performance. We can try improving the performance by adjusting the training options.\\n\\nMaxEpochs: We can increase the number of epochs over which we train the network. Generally, the longer we train the dataset, the more performance improves.\\n\\nInitialLearnRate: If we set our initial learning rate too high, we can cause the network to converge at a suboptimal solution. To improve performance, you can try dividing your initial learn rate by 10 and retrain the network.\\n\\nMiniBatchSize: You can try adjusting the mini-batch size. Smaller values typically mean faster convergence but more noise in the training process. Larger batch sizes mean more training time but generally less noise.\\n\\nThere are other training options that you can try adjusting that are dependent on the solver you chose. These options can be explored in the MATLAB documentation.\\n\\nYou can also improve performance by testing your network as you are training it; this process is called validation. In addition to setting aside some data for testing after training is complete, we also set aside a validation set. Every few iterations of training, we will classify the images of our validation set and assess the accuracy of the network. This allows us to see how prediction accuracy improves not only on our training data, but also on data the network hasn\\'t seen before. The validation data isn\\'t used to modify any of our network layers--it\\'s just a check to see how training is coming along.\\n\\nExample 3. Build a neural network\\n\\nIn some cases it may make more sense to train a network from scratch. This is particularly true if your dataset is very different from those that were used to train other networks.\\n\\nIn this example we will train a neural network to classify images of numerical digits. This uses images built into the MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox.\\n\\n{{< figure src=/notes/matlab-deep-learning/matlab-digits.png >}}\\n\\n1. Create an image datastore\\n\\nFirst we will create a datastore containing our images.\\n\\n```matlab % Retrieve the path to the demo dataset\\n\\ndigitDatasetPath = fullfile(matlabroot, \\'toolbox\\',\\'nnet\\',\\'nndemos\\',\\'nndatasets\\',\\'DigitDataset\\');\\n\\n% Create image datastore\\n\\nimds = imageDatastore(digitDatasetPath, \\'IncludeSubfolders\\', true, \\'LabelSource\\', \\'foldernames\\'); ```\\n\\n2. Split the data into training and test datasets\\n\\nmatlabn [train, test] = splitEachLabel(imds, 0.8, \\'randomized\\');\\n\\n3. Define the layers of your network (the network architecture).\\n\\nmatlab layers = [... imageInputLayer([28 28 1]) convolution2dLayer(5,20) reluLayer maxPooling2dLayer(2,\\'Stride\\',2) fullyConnectedLayer(10) softmaxLayer classificationLayer];\\n\\n4. Set your training options.\\n\\nmatlab options = trainingOptions(\\'sgdm\\', ... \\'MaxEpochs\\', 20, ... \\'InitialLearnRate\\', 1e-4, ... \\'Verbose\\', false, ... \\'Plots\\', \\'training-progress\\');\\n\\n5. Train the network\\n\\nmatlab net = trainNetwork(train, layers, options);\\n\\n6. Evaluate performance\\n\\n```matlab preds = classify(net, test);\\n\\nactual = test.Labels;\\n\\nnumCorrect = nnz(preds == actual);\\n\\nfracCorrect = numCorrect/length(actual);\\n\\nconfusionchart(actual, preds) ```')]\n",

This includes transferring and editing files, looking at output, and so forth. However, all production work must be run on the compute nodes, not on the frontends.\\n\\nA large, multi-user system like UVA\\'s HPC cluster must be managed by some form of resource manager to ensure equitable access for all users. Research Computing uses the Slurm resource manager. Resource managers are also often called queueing systems. Users submit jobs to the queueing system. A process called a scheduler examines the resource requests in each job and assigns a priority. The job then waits in a queue, which Slurm calls a partition, until the requested resource becomes available. A partition is a set of compute nodes with a particular set of resources and limits. There are partitions for single-node jobs, multiple-node jobs, GPU jobs, and some other dedicated partitions. A list of the different queues and resources are listed here.\\n\\nOpen OnDemand offers an easy way to run interactive jobs. With an interactive job, you are logged in directly to a compute node and can work as if it were a frontend.

Scripts are not standalone executables but must be run through an interpreter.\\n\\nAnything that can be executed or evaluated on the bash command line can be placed into a script.\\n\\nFrequently used to automate repetitive tasks:\\n\\n            * File handling\\\\, data backups\\n            * Schedule computing jobs\\\\, e\\\\.g\\\\. on UVA’s Rivanna High\\\\- Performance Computing Cluster\\\\.\\n\\nHow to write a script\\n\\n1) Bash shell environment to execute scripts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2) Needed: Text Editor to create and edit script files * - vi\\\\, vim\\\\, nano * - gedit through FastX * - avoid Windows Notepad\\\\, Microsoft Word\\n\\nOur Workspace Setup\\n\\nBasic Unix commands:\\n\\ncd \\\\\\n\\ncd ~/ changes to your home directory\\n\\npwd shows full path of current directory\\n\\nmkdir –p \\\\\\n\\nls lists non-hidden files in current directory\\n\\nls *.sh lists non-hidden files that end in .sh\\n\\nmv\\n\\ncd ~/\\n\\npwd\\n\\nmkdir scripts\\n\\ncd scripts\\n\\npwd\\n\\nls\\n\\nBash Script Structure: A Simple Example\\n\\nCreate script hello.sh\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n#This is a simple bash script\\n\\necho \"Hello world!\" #print greeting to screen\\n\\necho \"I am done now!\"\\n\\nThe first line tells the system to start the shell and execute the commands. It is sometimes called a “shebang” . An alternative is:\\n\\n#!/ usr /bin/ env _ bash_\\n\\nScripts can be annotated with comments\\\\, characters after the # character are ignored by the interpreter\\n\\nThe third and fourth line are commands.\\n\\nExecuting A Script\\n\\nSuppose the previous script was in a file hello.sh\\n\\nBy default it is just text. You must explicitly make it executable:\\n\\nchmod u+x hello.sh\\n\\nThen you can just invoke it by name at the command line:\\n\\n./hello.sh\\n\\nAlternative: Run via bash interpreter\\n\\nbash hello.sh\\n\\nComments and Line Continuations\\n\\nAll text from the # to the end of the line is ignored\\n\\nTo continue a statement on to the next line\\\\, type \\\\ \\\\\\n\\n#This is a comment\\n\\necho \"This line is too long I \\\\\\n\\nwant it to be on two lines\"\\n\\nMultiple statements can be placed on the same line when separated by the ;\\n\\na=20 ; b=3\\n\\nSourcing\\n\\nIf you execute the script as a standalone script\\\\, it starts a new shell -- that is what the shebang does -- if you do not use that you can type\\n\\nbash myscript.sh\\n\\nSometimes you just want to bundle up some commands that you repeat regularly and execute them within the current shell. To do this you should not include _ a _shebang \\\\, and you must source the script\\n\\n. \\\\')]\n",

Increasingly, these microorganisms can survive the effects of antibiotics previously used to kill them. As bacteria become resistant to multiple kinds of antibiotics, the diseases they cause become ever more difficult to cure. Accordingly, infections caused by ‘multidrug-resistant’ (MDR) pathogens are associated with frequent treatment failures, high hospitalization costs, and substantial mortality. New therapeutics are needed to treat infections caused by MDR bacteria. Towards developing these critical countermeasures, our group has discovered a unique peptide that efficiently kills many of the most challenging antibiotic-resistant pathogens and also demonstrates therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical animal models of bacterial infection. Interested in investigating the effect of replacing the canonical-amino acids by non-canonical amino acids (NCAA) to increase the efficacy of the peptide, a DAC team member has created a computational strategy to perform the screening of multiple-peptide positions using a NCAA peptide library and the high-performance computing capabilities of Research Computing. With good agreement between computational predictions and bench-top experiments, our collaboration with the DAC led to the following key points: * Determination of NCAA-containing preferred peptides with better predicted binding (under experimental testing) * Construction of the first structural model of the peptide (both canonical and non-canonical variants) with the potential bacterial target * Structure-function insights in search of optimized antimicrobial peptides towards better therapeutics (by utilizing NCAAs)\\n\\nThese investigations have set the stage for our continued collaboration with the DAC team member in this area including multiple state and federal grants that we will be targeting in 2025.\\n\\nPIs: Matthew A Crawford, PhD (Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases & International Health) and Molly A Hughes, PhD (Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases & International Health)')]\n",

In earlier eras, social scientists, journalists, and citizens could focus on static statements by politicians and candidates in order to understand the nature of political discourse. Social scientists studying political communication would design surveys and focus groups to understand which messages were received by citizens, and with what effect. Today, as news moves to digital platforms and as political figures increasingly rely on social media, political communication is fundamentally dynamic. Studying patterns of communication among politicians, their supporters, and their critics requires scholarly focus on the content, sentiment, and framing of posts on various social media platforms. Similarly, making sense of the contours of an election campaign requires that scholars explore the interplay among online messages and real-world events such as endorsements, scandals, and standing in the polls. All of this means that the tools of political analysis must be combined with the tools of data science.\\n\\nOver the past several years a team of researchers from the Department of Politics, the School of Data Science, and Research Computing have collaborated to create a system to capture and store every Tweet to and from every major presidential candidate since the 2016 primaries, continuing with every Tweet to and from President Trump since Election Day. This collaboration has produced a unique database of approximately one billion tweets (currently 5 TB). While the analysis of tweets from candidates and office holders is commonplace, collecting, organizing, and analyzing tweets to these figures, both from supporters and opponents, requires significant effort and sustained collaboration.\\n\\nPI: Paul Freedman (Department of Politics)')]\n",

ERCP is associated with higher rates of complications than other endoscopic procedures, one of the most severe being post-ERCP pancreatitis which is thought to take place in up to 10% of patients.\\n\\nDr. Podboy and Internal Medicine Resident Physician Dr. Jason Erno are interested in factors that may contribute to reduced outcomes of post-ERCP pancreatitis, such as the use of dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic agent. Research Computing’s Data Analytics Center investigated this by performing statistical and machine learning analyses of data from a retrospective cohort study who underwent ERCP at UVA in the last five years.

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Education, and Resilient Infrastructure.\\n\\nArctic communities face many challenges as they grow and develop in the context of a rapidly changing environment. These challenges include coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, and ecosystem change. This project is developing and deploying a network of environmental sensors collecting continuous information over a five-year period in terrestrial and aquatic locations within the community of Utqiagvik. The sensor network yields an unprecedented dataset for examining the interactive effects of the natural and built environments. This project is improving the health and economic well-being of Utqiagvik and potentially other North Slope Borough villages in Alaska.\\n\\nThis research investigates two essential challenges for the Arctic city of Utqiagvik, Alaska: i) the impacts of existing community infrastructure practices on the surrounding tundra, coastal, and lagoon landscapes within and around the city, and ii) the impacts of a changing environment on the design and future planning of community infrastructure and buildings. The ultimate goal of the project is to understand how the natural and built environments interact with social systems in an Arctic city.\\n\\nUVA Research Computing is supporting this research by hosting computational services to ingest, process, transform, store, and serve sensor data over the life of the project. A scalable data service named HSDS runs within a containerized environment in the HPC networks to aggregate the collected sensor data. This service is backed by object storage, and is then served internally for research using a variety of data analysis tools.\\n\\nData: https://arcticdata.io/\\n\\nAward: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2022639\\n\\nPI: Howard Epstein, Chair, Dept. of Environmental Sciences.')]\n",

This is accomplished using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), an emergency department triage algorithm that classifies patient cases into five different levels of urgency. Researchers are interested in using machine learning to develop a model to predict patient triage level. This model would not only analyze the typical vital signs that are used in the ESI, but also demographic data and patients’ history of health.\\n\\nDemographic and health data have been collected. RC is helping to prepare and normalize the data for use in a machine learning model. RC is currently developing preliminary machine learning models for predicting triage level.\\n\\nPI: Thomas Hartka (Department of Emergency Medicine)')]\n",

The simulations are performed with a highly-optimized parallel computer code capable of reproducing collective dynamics in systems consisting of up to billions of atoms. As a result, the simulations naturally account for the complexity of the material response to the rapid laser energy deposition and provide clear visual representations, or “atomic movies,” of laser-induced dynamic processes. The mechanistic insights revealed in the simulations have an immediate impact on the development of the theoretical understanding of laser-induced processes and assist in optimization of laser processing parameters in current applications based on laser surface modification and nanoparticle generation in laser ablation.\\n\\nPI: Leonid V.

This is an image of dye fluxing from the surface of the Hawaiian coral Porites compressa utilizing a technique known as planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF). Reefs such as this one have been severely impacted by human alteration, both locally through additional inputs of sediments and nutrients, and globally through increased sea surface temperatures caused by climate change. Reidenbach is hopeful that his computational models will allow scientists to better predict the future health of reefs based on human activity and improve global reef restoration efforts.\\n\\nPI: Matthew Reidenbach, PhD (Department of Environmental Sciences)')]\n",

These allocations are time-limited and generally allow access to a restricted set of nodes and only one special Slurm partition, but are otherwise equivalent to any allocation.\\n\\nResource Availability\\n\\nHardware and Partition\\n\\nInstructional allocations may use interactive partition. The instructional allocation is 100,000 SUs for the semester during which the course is conducted. For workshops, the allocation will persist during the workshop and for two days afterwards. RC offers several low-cost storage options to researchers, including 10TB of Research Standard storage for each eligible PI at no charge. Instructors are encouraged to utilize this 10TB of storage for both research and teaching activities. For more detailed descriptions of our storage options, visit https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/storage/.\\n\\nSoftware & Storage Environment\\n\\nResearch Computing\\'s primary focus is supporting the direct research mission of the University. Instructional allocations are provided in recognition of the many areas where the educational and research missions of the University meet, and in recognition that there is value in providing UVA\\'s diverse communities with experience in an HPC environment. However, staff time is a highly limited resource and instructional use of RC systems as a largely \\'as-is\\' service with standardized software and storage environments. We are unable to provide customization of the environment for specific classes.\\n\\nInterface\\n\\nFor most classes, we recommend the Open OnDemand interface if it suits the expected usage. This does not require knowledge of Unix and greatly reduces the training burden. The Open OnDemand interface requires only Netbadge credentials and can be accessed without a VPN from off Grounds.\\n\\nIf Open OnDemand is not adequate, the other recommended interface is FastX Web. This is a remote desktop application and requires the students to be able to navigate a Unix desktop system. Access from off Grounds via FastX requires a VPN connection.\\n\\nFastX connects only to a frontend. We significantly restrict the time, memory, and cores available to frontend jobs. If students are running anything but very short jobs, the Open OnDemand applications should be utilized. These access the compute nodes and are far less limited. Open OnDemand provides a remote desktop on compute nodes as well as direct access to JupyterLab, the Matlab Desktop, and Rstudio Server.\\n\\nHow to Submit a Request\\n\\nInstructors planning to use HPC should fill out the form. You will need to create the Grouper (requires VPN connection) allocation group. We suggest a generic group name related to the course rubric, e.g. cs5014. Once the group is created, the instructor or a designated group administrator will need to add the student IDs. The instructor should empty the membership of the group after the class or workshop has terminated. Instructors will need to submit an instructional allocation renewal request at the start of each semester.\\n\\nUsing the Allocation\\n\\nPrior to the first class use, instructors should test the allocation and the software applications required during class. Please do not wait until multiple students are attempting to use it.\\n\\nPasswords\\n\\nStudents, particularly undergraduates, frequently experience password difficulties. Rivanna and Afton use the Eservices password to authenticate, but few students know this password. Instructors are urged to communicate to students that they should go to the ITS password page at least several hours in advance and change their Netbadge password before using the system. Changing the Netbadge password will sync the Eservices password with it.\\n\\nPartition and Reservations\\n\\nThe allocation will have access to the interactive partition. Students can enter this with the -p or --partition options to Slurm. ```\\n\\nSBATCH -p interactive\\n\\nor\\n\\nSBATCH --partition=interactive\\n\\n``` If students use the Open OnDemand interface, they will enter this into the appropriate textbox when starting their interactive job application.\\n\\nInstructors are urged to request reservations for their classes. The reservation will be created to coincide with the class meeting time. Students must add an option --reservation=your-reservation in order to access the reserved resources. Students may still use the instructional partition outside the reservation, but those jobs will wait like any other queued job. Outside the dedicated reservation window jobs should be submitted without the --reservation flag for immediate queueing; otherwise the job will be pending until the next reservation window opens.\\n\\nFor batch jobs, the reservation can be entered on the command line sbatch --reservation=your-reservation myscript.slurm or it can be added to the job script preamble ```\\n\\nSBATCH --reservation=your-reservation\\n\\n``` For Open OnDemand interactive applications, it should be entered as an additional Slurm option.\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nResearch Computing staff are available to come to a class session to provide training to the students. This can be done in-person, when possible, or virtually through Zoom.')]\n",

Form Structure\\n\\nThe form dynamically adjusts based on the selected request type.\\n\\nService Unit (SU) Requests\\n\\nNew Request: Users select a Group, Tier, and input billing details.\\n\\nRenewal: Users select from an Existing SU Table, and only the update_date is changed.\\n\\nStorage Requests\\n\\nNew Storage: Users pick a storage tier and specify allocation details.\\n\\nModify Storage: Users choose an existing project from the Existing Storage Table.\\n\\nBilling Information\\n\\nDisplayed dynamically if a selected request requires billing.\\n\\n⚙️ 2. JavaScript Architecture\\n\\nThe core JavaScript file combined-request-form.js manages: - Dynamic form updates based on user selections. - Fetching and displaying user resources. - Validating inputs and preventing invalid submissions. - Building and submitting API payloads.\\n\\nKey JavaScript Functions\\n\\nFunction Description fetchMetadata() Fetches storage tier limits and billing rules from API. fetchAndPopulateGroups() Retrieves user groups and resources dynamically. updatePayloadPreview() Shows real-time request preview before submission. validatePayload(payload) Ensures API payload structure is correct. submitForm(formData, payload) Sends request via POST (New) or PUT (Renewal). processUserResources(apiResponse) Populates user’s Existing SU Table .\\n\\n🖱 3. Event Handling & Interactivity\\n\\nJavaScript dynamically updates the UI based on user actions.\\n\\nKey Event Listeners\\n\\nEvent Function Triggered Description Change on request-type toggleRequestFields() Toggles between Service Unit and Storage Requests . Change on new-or-renewal toggleAllocationFields() Shows correct fields for New vs Renewal . Change on existing-project-allocation updatePayloadPreview() Updates the API payload preview. Change on any form input updateBillingVisibility() Shows/hides Billing Information . Form Submit handleFormSubmit(event) Collects data, validates, and submits the request.\\n\\n🔄 4. Fetching and Processing User Data\\n\\nAt page load, fetchAndPopulateGroups() retrieves: - User Groups - Existing Service Unit Allocations - Storage Requests\\n\\nFetched data is stored in consoleData and updates: 1. Existing SU Table (populateExistingServiceUnitsTable()) 2. Existing Storage Requests Table (if applicable)\\n\\n🛠 5. Payload Construction (New & Renewal Requests)\\n\\nNew SU Requests (POST)\\n\\nUser selects Group and Tier.\\n\\nBilling details are included if applicable.\\n\\nRequest count defaults to 1000 unless specified.\\n\\nPayload structure: json [ { \"group_name\": \"RC_Staff\", \"project_name\": \"Test Project\", \"project_desc\": \"This is free text\", \"data_agreement_signed\": true, \"pi_uid\": \"UVAComputingID\", \"resources\": { \"hpc_service_units\": { \"CACS_Staff\": { \"tier\": \"ssz_project\", \"request_count\": \"1000\", \"billing_details\": { \"fdm_billing_info\": [ { \"financial_contact\": \"First Name Last Name\", \"company\": \"234324\", \"business_unit\": \"3\", \"cost_center\": \"224\", \"fund\": \"a Fund\", \"gift\": \"\", \"grant\": \"\", \"designated\": \"\", \"project\": \"\", \"program_code\": \"a program\", \"function\": \"A Function\", \"activity\": \"an activity\", \"assignee\": \"an assignee\" } ] } } } }, \"user_resources\": [] } ]\\n\\nRenewal Requests (PUT)\\n\\nThe user selects an existing SU instead of filling in a new group.\\n\\nThe only change allowed is updating the update_date.\\n\\nThe API payload includes the existing group, tier, and updated timestamp. json [ { \"group_name\": \"RC_Staff\", \"project_name\": \"Existing Project\", \"resources\": { \"hpc_service_units\": { \"CACS_Staff-ssz_standard\": { \"tier\": \"ssz_standard\", \"request_count\": \"50000\", \"update_date\": \"2025-02-12T10:30:00Z\" \"billing_details\": { \"fdm_billing_info\": [ { \"financial_contact\": \"First Name Last Name\", \"company\": \"234324\", \"business_unit\": \"3\", \"cost_center\": \"224\", \"fund\": \"a Fund\", \"gift\": \"\", \"grant\": \"\", \"designated\": \"\", \"project\": \"\", \"program_code\": \"a program\", \"function\": \"A Function\", \"activity\": \"an activity\", \"assignee\": \"an assignee\" } ] } } } } } ]\\n\\n6. Form Submission & API Communication\\n\\nThe submitForm() function determines whether to POST or PUT based on the selected New vs Renewal option.\\n\\nNew Requests → POST to: https://uvarc-unified-service.pods.uvarc.io/uvarc/api/resource/rcwebform/user/{userId}\\n\\nRenewal Requests → PUT to: https://uvarc-unified-service.pods.uvarc.io/uvarc/api/resource/rcwebform/user/{userId}/{resource_id}\\n\\n7. Validation & Error Handling\\n\\nBefore submission, validatePayload(payload) checks for:\\n\\nMissing required fields (group, tier, request count).\\n\\nDuplicate group/tier combinations.\\n\\nCorrect formatting of billing details (when required).\\n\\nErrors trigger showErrorMessage(), and invalid fields are marked red.\\n\\n8. UI Behaviors & Additional Features\\n\\n✅ Real-Time Payload Preview\\n\\nThe function updatePayloadPreview() shows the request payload before submission.\\n\\n✅ Billing Visibility\\n\\nThe form automatically hides/shows billing details based on the selected SU or Storage option.\\n\\n✅ Sorting of Existing SU Table\\n\\nNewest allocations appear first in the Existing SU table.')]\n",
