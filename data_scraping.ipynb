Containers eliminate that issue altogether!\\n\\nA container is a single unit of software that contains all the packages and code you need to run an application. Sometimes that application is as small as a single function (like printing ‘Hello World!'), and sometimes that application is an entire web app. A container will always run the same, regardless of the host system it runs on–making it the perfect solution for sharing reproducible code.\\n\\nThere are several container technologies out there, but the big ones are Docker and Singularity. Docker is what you will encounter most often in the wild. Singularity (now called Apptainer) is used on HPC systems where most users don’t have root access.\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nWhat Are Containers?\\n\\nNext\\n\\nContainers vs VMs\\n\\nLast updated on May 1, 2023\\n\\n Â©Â\\xa02025 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia \\n \\n\\nCite\\n\\n×\\n\\n Copy\\n \\n\\n Download\",\n",

The big difference between VMs and containers is that VMs provide their own guest OS, whereas containers don’t require an OS and run on the Docker Engine and share the host’s OS kernel.\\n\\nThe size of Docker images is usually on the order of tens of MBs, while VMs can be several tens of GBs large.\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nWhy Use Containers?\\n\\nNext\\n\\nContainer Services\\n\\nLast updated on May 1, 2023\\n\\n Â©Â\\xa02025 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia \\n \\n\\nCite\\n\\n×\\n\\n Copy\\n \\n\\n Download',\n",

Such applications are typically run within containers, made popular in the last few years by Docker.\\n\\nContainers are portable, efficient, reusable, and contain code and any dependencies in a single package. Containerized services typically run a single process, rather than an entire stack within the same environment. This allows developers to replace, scale, or troubleshoot portions of their entire application at a time.\\n\\nResearch Computing runs microservices in a clustered orchestration environment that automates the deployment and management of many containers easy and scalable. This cluster has >1000 cores and ~1TB of memory allocated to running containerized services. It also has over 300TB of cluster storage and can attach to project and value storage.\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nContainers vs VMs\\n\\nNext\\n\\nContainer Basics\\n\\nLast updated on May 1, 2023\\n\\n Â©Â\\xa02025 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia \\n \\n\\nCite\\n\\n×\\n\\n Copy\\n \\n\\n Download',\n",

We will cover each section below.\\n\\n1. Choose a base image\\n\\n# Install R version 4.1.2\\nFROM r-base:4.1.2\\n\\nIn this section we are specifying that we are starting with the r-base Docker image. The r-base container uses Ubuntu and already has R installed, so we don’t need to worry about installing that ourselves. There are many other base containers out there that you can use depending on what kind of app you’re developing.\\n\\n2. Install Ubuntu packages and libraries\\n\\nThe following packages and libraries will allow us to install Shiny server and various R packages that we need for our app. This list will cover most of your bases for most Shiny apps. If you find you need additional libraries, you can just add them to this list.\\n\\nHow do you know if you’re missing a library? You’ll get an error message, and we will cover how to debug in a later section.\\n\\n# Install Ubuntu packages\\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\\\\n sudo \\\\\\n gdebi-core \\\\\\n pandoc \\\\\\n libcurl4-gnutls-dev \\\\\\n libcairo2-dev/unstable \\\\\\n libxt-dev \\\\\\n libssl-dev \\\\\\n libxml2-dev \\\\\\n libnlopt-dev \\\\\\n libudunits2-dev \\\\\\n libgeos-dev \\\\\\n libfreetype6-dev \\\\\\n libpng-dev \\\\\\n libtiff5-dev \\\\\\n libjpeg-dev \\\\\\n libgdal-dev \\\\\\n git \\n\\n3. Install Shiny server\\n\\nThis just installs Shiny server in your image. If you’re not developing a Shiny app, no need to include it. If you \\nare\\n developing a Shiny app, no need to change it!\\n\\n# Install Shiny server\\nRUN wget --no-verbose https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-shiny-server-os-build/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/VERSION -O \"version.txt\" && \\\\\\n VERSION=$(cat version.txt) && \\\\\\n wget \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-shiny-server-os-build/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/shiny-server-$VERSION-amd64.deb\" -O ss-latest.deb && \\\\\\n gdebi -n ss-latest.deb && \\\\\\n rm -f version.txt ss-latest.deb\\n\\n4. Install R Packages\\n\\nHere we are installing all the packages that we need for our Shiny app. Again, if you’re not developing a Shiny app, you can skip this part.\\n\\n##### Install R packages that are required ######\\n## CRAN packages\\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c(\\'shiny\\',\\'shinydashboard\\',\\'dplyr\\',\\'ggplot2\\',\\'fresh\\'))\"\\n\\n5. Copy configuration files to the Docker image\\n\\nThese are just some files that make our Shiny app run. These will be in the directory that your app is in. These will be the same for all Shiny apps.\\n\\n# Copy configuration files into the Docker image\\nCOPY shiny-server.conf /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf\\nCOPY shiny-server.sh /usr/bin/shiny-server.sh\\nRUN rm -rf /srv/shiny-server/*\\n\\n6. Copy your code to your app\\n\\nIdeally your code will be maintained within a GitHub repository (we will cover how to do this in a later section). Here we are cloning the GitHub repo and copying the contents to the shiny-server folder.\\n\\n# Get the app code\\nRUN git clone https://github.com/uvarc/chickweight.git\\nCOPY chickweight/* /srv/shiny-server/\\nRUN rm -rf chickweight\\n\\n7. Some R and Shiny Stuff\\n\\nThis is just some stuff for setting R paths, etc.\\n\\n# Make the ShinyApp available at port 80\\nENV R_HOME=/usr/lib/R\\nENV PATH=/usr/lib/R:/usr/lib/R/bin:$PATH\\nEXPOSE 80\\nWORKDIR /srv/shiny-server\\nRUN chown shiny.shiny /usr/bin/shiny-server.sh && chmod 755 /usr/bin/shiny-server.sh\\n\\n8. Run the Shiny app!\\n\\nThe CMD just tells the container what to run once it starts. This line starts up the Shiny server and app.\\n\\n# Run the server setup script\\nCMD [\"/usr/bin/shiny-server.sh\"]\\n\\nOnce we’re done writing the Dockerfile, we save it as “Dockerfile” (no file extension).\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nServing a ShinyApp\\n\\nNext\\n\\nBuilding the App Image\\n\\nLast updated on May 1, 2023\\n\\n Â©Â\\xa02025 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia \\n \\n\\nCite\\n\\n×\\n\\n Copy\\n \\n\\n Download',\n",

You don’t have to use 8080, you can use another number if you want.\\n\\nDebugging\\n\\nWhat if there’s something wrong with the image for our Shiny app? How will we know? If there’s an error, we’ll see this message:\\n\\nHow do we go about debugging this? We’ll need to take a peek into our app. We will use \\ndocker run\\n like before, but this time we will run the container interactively.\\n\\ndocker run -it -p 8888:80 <dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<tag> /bin/bash\\n\\n-it\\n allows us to run the container interactively\\n\\nWith \\n/bin/bash\\n, we are entering the container in a bash shell.\\n\\nWe use port 8888 instead of 8080, because we need to restart Docker Desktop in order to use 8080 again.\\n\\nWhen we try going to \\n\\nlocalhost:8888\\n, the app isn’t running yet. We had a command at the end of our Dockerfile to start up Shiny server and run our app, but we just replaced that with \\n/bin/bash\\n. So within our new container, let’s run \\n/usr/bin/shiny-server.sh\\n.\\n\\nNow we see that error message again when we reload the page in the browser.

The two main options are DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).\\n\\nFor this workshop, we’re going to use GHCR. The main benefit of using GHCR over DockerHub is that it is less restrictive with how many times your image can be pulled in an hour.\\n\\nRe-tagging our image\\n\\nTo use GHCR, we need to prepend our image name with \\nghcr.io/<github-username>\\n. That means we will need to re-tag our image. We can do that with the \\ndocker tag\\n command.\\n\\ndocker tag cagancayco/chickweight:latest ghcr.io/uvarc/chickweight\\n\\nAllowing Docker to push to GHCR\\n\\nIf this is your first time using GHCR, it is likely that you need to authorize your local Docker installation to push to GitHub.\\n\\nGo to GitHub -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens, or click \\n\\nhere\\n.\\n\\nGenerate new token with read/write permissions for packages.\\n\\nCopy the token to the clipboard.\\n\\nIn your terminal, run\\n\\ndocker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> -p <copied-token>\\n\\nNow we can use \\ndocker push\\n to push our container to GitHub!\\n\\ndocker push ghcr.io/uvarc/chickweight\\n\\nSet the package to public\\n\\nBy default, GHCR packages (or images) are set to private. We need them to be public in order for the Kubernetes cluster to see it. To change the visibility, do the following:\\n\\nGo to Packages -> chickweight -> Package Settings\\n\\nClick “change visibility” and follow the on-screen instructions.\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nRunning and Debugging\\n\\nNext\\n\\nVersion Control\\n\\nLast updated on May 1, 2023\\n\\n Â©Â\\xa02025 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia \\n \\n\\nCite\\n\\n×\\n\\n Copy\\n \\n\\n Download',\n",

Containers eliminate that issue altogether!\\n\\nA container is a single unit of software that contains all the packages and code you need to run an application. Sometimes that application is as small as a single function (like printing ‘Hello World!'), and sometimes that application is an entire web app. A container will always run the same, regardless of the host system it runs on–making it the perfect solution for sharing reproducible code.\\n\\nThere are several container technologies out there, but the big ones are Docker and Singularity. Docker is what you will encounter most often in the wild. Singularity (now called Apptainer) is used on HPC systems where most users don’t have root access.\",\n",

The big difference between VMs and containers is that VMs provide their own guest OS, whereas containers don’t require an OS and run on the Docker Engine and share the host’s OS kernel.\\n\\nThe size of Docker images is usually on the order of tens of MBs, while VMs can be several tens of GBs large.',\n",

Such applications are typically run within containers, made popular in the last few years by Docker.\\n\\nContainers are portable, efficient, reusable, and contain code and any dependencies in a single package. Containerized services typically run a single process, rather than an entire stack within the same environment. This allows developers to replace, scale, or troubleshoot portions of their entire application at a time.\\n\\nResearch Computing runs microservices in a clustered orchestration environment that automates the deployment and management of many containers easy and scalable. This cluster has >1000 cores and ~1TB of memory allocated to running containerized services. It also has over 300TB of cluster storage and can attach to project and value storage.',\n",
