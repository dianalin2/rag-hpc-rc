## BART (Binding Analysis for Regulation of Transcription) Web

Working with researchers in the [Zang Lab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/) in the Center for Public Health Genomics 
(CPHG), RC helped launch BARTweb,
an interactive web-based tool for users to analyze their Genelist or ChIP-seq datasets. BARTweb is a containerized
Flask front-end (written in Python) that ingests files and submits them to a more robust Python-based genomics pipeline 
running on Rivanna, UVA's high performance computing cluster (HPC). This architecture -- of a public web application that 
uses a supercomputer to process data -- is a new model for UVA, and one that eases the learning curve for researchers who 
may not have access to an HPC system or the expertise to run a BART pipeline in the command-line.
