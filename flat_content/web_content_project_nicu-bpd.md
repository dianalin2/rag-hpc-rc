Episodes of bradycardia and oxygen desaturation (BD) are common among preterm very low birthweight (VLBW) infants and their association with adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unclear. A better understanding of this relationship could lead to improved clinical interventions.

RC is helping neonatologists describe BD events in a large single-NICU VLBW cohort and test the hypothesis that measures of BD in the neonatal period add to clinical variables to predict BPD or death and other adverse outcomes. RC has implemented statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to assess the primary outcome of BPD in the context of a combination of clinical characteristics (like birthweight and gestational age) and bedside monitor features.
