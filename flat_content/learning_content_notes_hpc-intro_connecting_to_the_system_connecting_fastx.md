FastX is a Web-based desktop environment for HPC. It is accessible either through the [Open OnDemand Interactive Apps](https://ood.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) menu, or directly at [fastx.hpc.virginia.edu](https://fastx.hpc.virginia.edu).

FastX requires the VPN.  If the VPN is not active, the start page _will not_ load.

Always use either the OOD link or the `fastx` URL.  The underlying name of the host may change from time to time.
