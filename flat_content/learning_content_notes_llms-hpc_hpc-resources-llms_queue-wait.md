You may not need to request an A100 GPU!

Requesting an A100 may mean you wait in the queue for a much longer time than using another GPU. This could give you a slower overall time (wait time + execution time) than if you had used another GPU.

**When you request memory for HPC, that is CPU memory.**

If you request a GPU, you will receive all of the GPU memory.
