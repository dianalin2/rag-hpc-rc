Phase 1 of the maintenance period is now complete. Rivanna’s standard, GPU, largemem, and front-end nodes have been returned to service. Pending jobs that were submitted before the maintenance began need to be resubmitted.

Rivanna’s parallel nodes will be released in phase 2 which we anticipate being finished by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, December 22.
