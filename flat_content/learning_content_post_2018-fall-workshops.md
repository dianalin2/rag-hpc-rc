School of Medicine Research Computing provides training opportunities covering a variety of data analysis, basic programming 
and computational topics. 

Workshops break roughly into the three main areas relevant to computationally-intensive research: **code**, **data**, and **computing**.

All of the classes are taught by RC experts and are freely available to UVa faculty, staff and students.
