During the July 18th maintenance, we installed a new `/scratch` file storage system on Rivanna. We have created sample scripts and instructions to help you transfer your files from the previous file system to the new one. These instructions are available [here](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/2023/07/rivanna-maintenance-july-18-2023/)
