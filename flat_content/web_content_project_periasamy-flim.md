Multiphoton FLIM microscopy offers many opportunities to investigate processes in live cells, tissue and animal model systems. For redox measurements, FLIM data is mostly published by cell mean values and intensity-based redox ratios. Our method is based entirely on FLIM parameters generated by 3-detector time domain microscopy capturing autofluorescent signals of NAD(P)H, FAD and novel FLIM-FRET application of Tryptophan and NAD(P)H-a2%/FAD-a1% redox ratio. Furthermore, image data is analyzed in segmented cells thresholded by 2 × 2 pixel Regions of Interest (ROIs) to separate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation from cytosolic glycolysis in a prostate cancer cell line. Hundreds of data points allow demonstration of heterogeneity in response to intervention, identity of cell responders to treatment, creating thereby different subpopulations. Histograms and bar charts visualize differences between cells, analyzing whole cell versus mitochondrial morphology data, all based on discrete ROIs. This assay method allows to detect subtle differences in cellular and tissue responses, suggesting an advancement over means-based analyses.
