There are limited evidence-based published heart rate ranges for premature neonates. However, knowing heart rate reference ranges in the premature neonatal population can be beneficial for bedside assessment in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

RC is collaborating with clinical researchers in the Department of Pediatrics to establish baseline ranges for heart rate data in premature infants. These results are summarized from more than two billion data points collected via bedside monitoring in the NICU. RC staff has contributed data analysis and visualization expertise to aggregate the data, generate interactive heatmaps and produce tables of these ranges by gestational age.
