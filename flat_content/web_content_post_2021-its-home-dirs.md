ITS has completed phase 1 of its network reconfiguration and ITS NAS storage volumes have been remounted on Rivanna. RC managed _Research Standard_ and _Research Project_ storage are also fully available. ITS `home1` directories, including `/nv/t*` mounts, remain unavailable on Rivanna. Users will still be able to mount ITS `home1` storage to their local workstations and transfer their data via Globus and the UVA Main DTN. We regret the inconvenience.
