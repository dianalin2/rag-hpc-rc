# Basic Steps

Strictly speaking, you cannot add packages to an existing container since it is not editable. However, you can try to install missing packages locally. Using python-pip as an example:

```
module load apptainer
apptainer exec <container.sif> python -m pip install --user <package>
```

Replace `<container.sif>` with the actual filename of the container and `<package>` with the package name. The Python package will be installed in your home directory under `.local/lib/pythonX.Y` where `X.Y` is the Python version in the container.

If the installation results in a binary, it will often be placed in `.local/bin`. Remember to add this to your `PATH`:

```
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
```

You should be able to use the new package/binary in the container, as your entire home directory is mounted at runtime.

# Handling Errors

Installation may fail in more complicated scenarios, where additional libraries are needed. As a first step, load related modules (e.g. if you see "GLIBC not found" then load gcc) and try again.
