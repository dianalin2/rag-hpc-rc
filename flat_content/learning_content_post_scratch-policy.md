Beginning 10/14/2019 RC system engineers will begin actively clearing `/scratch` files that have not been accessed for 90 days. `/scratch` is intended as a temporary work directory (90 days maximum).
It is not backed up and needs to be purged periodically in order to maintain a stable HPC environment. We encourage users to back up their important data.
RC offers several low-cost storage options to researchers.

For more information about research computing storage options:
